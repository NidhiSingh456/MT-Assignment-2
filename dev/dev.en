FSI allowed as per current norms in CRZ areas Greater opportunity for Development of densely populated rural areas Tourism Infrastructure for basic amenities to be promoted CRZ clearance streamlined No Development Zone of 20 meters for All Islands Special importance to All Ecologically Sensitive Areas Special focus on Pollution abatement
It will not only result in significant employment generation but also to better life and add value to the economy of India.
The new notification is expected to rejuvenate the coastal areas while reducing their vulnerabilities.
(i) Allowing FSI as per current norms in CRZ areas: As per CRZ, 2011 Notification, for CRZ-II (Urban) areas, Floor Space Index (FSI) or the Floor Area Ratio (FAR) had been frozen as per 1991 Development Control Regulation (DCR) levels.
In the CRZ, 2018 Notification, it has been decided to de-freeze the same and permit FSI for construction projects, as prevailing on the date of the new Notification.
This will enable redevelopment of these areas to meet the emerging needs.
(ii) Densely populated rural areas to be afforded greater opportunity for development: For CRZ-III (Rural) areas, two separate categories have now been stipulated as below:
(a) CRZ-III A – These are densely populated rural areas with a population density of 2161 per square kilometre as per 2011 Census.
Such areas shall have a No Development Zone (NDZ) of 50 meters from the HTL as against 200 meters from the High Tide Line stipulated in the CRZ Notification, 2011 since such areas have similar characteristics as urban areas.
(b) CRZ-III B – Rural areas with population density of below 2161 per square kilometre as per 2011 Census.
Such areas shall continue to have an NDZ of 200 meters from the HTL.
(iii)Tourism infrastructure for basic amenities to be promoted: Temporary tourism facilities such as shacks, toilet blocks, change rooms, drinking water facilities etc. have now been permitted in Beaches.
Such temporary tourism facilities are also now permissible in the “No Development Zone” (NDZ) of the CRZ-III areas as per the Notification.
However, a minimum distance of 10 m from HTL should be maintained for setting up of such facilities.
(iv)CRZ Clearances streamlined: The procedure for CRZ clearances has been streamlined.
Only such projects/activities, which are located in the CRZ-I (Ecologically Sensitive Areas) and CRZ IV (area covered between Low Tide Line and 12 Nautical Miles seaward) shall be dealt with for CRZ clearance by the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change.
The powers for clearances with respect to CRZ-II and III have been delegated at the State level with necessary guidance.
(vi) All Ecologically Sensitive Areas have been accorded special importance: Specific guidelines related to their conservation and management plans have been drawn up as a part of the CRZ Notification.
With the objective of conservation and protection of the coastal environment, Ministry of Environment and Forest and Climate Change notified the Coastal Regulation Zone Notification in 1991, which was subsequently revised in 2011.
The notification was amended from time to time based on representations received.
A need was felt overtime to undertake a comprehensive revision of the notification on the basis of number of representations from various Coastal States/UTs, besides other stakeholders particularly related to the management and conservation of marine and coastal eco-systems, development in coastal areas, eco-tourism, livelihood options and sustainable development of coastal communities etc.
Therefore, the Ministry of Environment, Forest & Climate Change constituted a Committee in June 2014 under the Chairmanship of Dr. Shailesh Nayak (Secretary, Ministry of Earth Sciences) to examine the various issues and concerns of Coastal States/UTs and other stakeholders for recommending appropriate changes in the CRZ Notification, 2011.
The Shailesh Nayank Committee held wide ranging consultations with State Governments and other stakeholders and submitted its recommendations in 2015.
The recommendations were further examined in consultation with Members of Parliament of Coastal States and Union Territories besides other concerned Ministries of Government of India.
A draft notification was issued in April, 2018 for inviting comments from public at large.
The changes brought about in the CRZ Notification will further add to creating additional opportunities for affordable housing.
Tourism has been one of the greatest creators of livelihood and jobs.
The new Notification will boost tourism in terms of more activities, more infrastructure and more opportunities and will certainly go a long way in creating employment opportunities in various aspects of tourism.
This will also give boost to people, desirous of seeing and enjoying the beauty of the mighty seas.

We are working to connect the institutional investors in UAE with our National Investment and Infrastructure Fund.
I also shared with His Highness the interest of Indian companies to be a partner in infrastructure projects for the World EXPO 2020 in Dubai.
We can jointly tap abundant opportunities in our initiatives aimed at building digital economy, human capital and smart urbanization in India.

Minister for Petroleum and Natural Gas, India
Secretary General, International Energy Forum
Ladies and Gentlemen.
Welcome to India.
Welcome to the 16thInternational Energy Forum Ministerial Meeting.
As you come together today to discuss the future of global energy,the world is seeing a great transition in energy supply and consumption.
• Consumption growth has shifted to non OECD countries: Middle East, Africa and developing Asia;
• Abundant availability of natural gas globally with increased percentage of LNG and natural gas is contributing to the primary energy basket;
• Coal may gradually go out of favour as a major contributor to primary energy in the OECD World and later in developing countries;
Last month I came across an energy forecastprepared by an agency, according to whichIndia will be the key driver of global energy demand in the next twenty-five years.
We are entering an era of energy abundance.
Let me share with you some of my thoughtson the hydrocarbon sector and our endeavourto achieve energy security.
Oil and Gas are a commodity of tradebut also of necessity.
Whether it is for the kitchen of a common manor for an aircraft,energy is essential.
We need to move to responsible pricing,which balances the interests of both the producer and consumer.
Efforts at artificially distorting prices are self-defeating,as history has shown us.
Let us use this platformto build a global consensus on ‘responsible pricing.’This will serve the mutual interestsof both producers and consumers.
Energy in general and hydrocarbons in particularare an important part of my vision for India’s future.
India needs energy which is accessibleand affordable to the poor.
India is also blessed with demographic dividend.The working age population as a share in total population,is one of the highest in the World.
The Enhanced Oil Recovery Policyaims to promote the use of latest technologyin improving productivity of up-stream fields.
Our Down-stream sectorhas been completely liberalizedwith market driven petrol and diesel pricesreflecting the changes in price of crude oil.
Our government has encouraged private participationacross the entire oil and gas value chainfrom up-stream production to down-stream retail.
This,we believe,would go a long waytowards achieving three energy related componentsof the United Nations Sustainable Development Agenda.Namely:
Universal access to modern energy by 2030;
Urgent action to tackle climate change – in line with the Paris agreement;
Measures to improve air quality;
Women benefit the most from it.
In India, throughthe UjjwalaYojana we provide free LPG connections to women from poorhouseholds.
In fact, here in New Delhi,we have already started offering BS Six standard fuel this month.
We have also launched a vehicle scrapping policywhich will help replace old vehicles with cleaner and energy efficient vehicles.
Our oil companies are assessing all their investmentskeeping in view the energy diversification strategies.
Today, oil companies are also investing in wind and solar capacities,gas infrastructure,and also thinking in the direction of investing in Electric Vehicle and Storage areas.
As we are all aware, we are now looking towards Industry 4.0, proposing to change the way industry operates in the future with new technologies and processes like Internet of Things, Artificial intelligence, robotics process automation, machine learning, predictive analytics, 3-D printing, etc.
These are all pertinentsubjects for the future of our collective energy security.
I wish you all a successful and fruitful Ministerial Conference.
The Union Cabinet chaired by Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has given its ex-post facto approval to the Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) between India and Tajikistan on Cooperation on Youth Matters.
An MoU between India and Tajikistan to promote cooperation on Youth matters between the two countries was signed on 8/10/2018 at Dushanbe.
The MoU was signed by Shri Somnath Ghosh, Ambassador of India to Tajikistan, for Youth Affairs and Sports, Govt. of India and Mr. AbdullozodaAhtamRustam, Chairman of the Committee for Youth and Sports Affairs for the Government of the Republic of Tajikistan.
The MoU shall remain valid for a period of five (5) years.
The Agreement will facilitate exchange programmes in the field of Youth Affairs, which will help in promoting exchange of ideas, values and culture amongst Youth and in consolidating friendly relations between India and Tajikistan.
The benefits arising from such bilateral exchange programmes between both countries would be equally available to all youth irrespective of their caste, religion and gender.
These will further help in developing international perspective among the Youth and expanding their knowledge and expertise in the areas of Youth Affairs.
PM: Indian Railways will not be privatized; private investment will be used to facilitate modernization.
Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, today declared categorically that the Indian Railways would not be privatized.
He was addressing a gathering in Varanasi after the commencement of expansion of the Diesel Locomotive Works.
He said private investment would be used to modernize Railways and make it service-oriented, so that it could become an engine of growth for the Nation.
Shri Narendra Modi said 4 rail universities would be established to ensure proper and well-trained human resource for the Railways.
He said the Railways should not be seen as just a means of transport, but should become the backbone of economic development.
He exhorted Railway workers to ensure that the best service in India is provided by the Indian Railways.
He recalled former Prime Minister Lal Bahadur Shastri’s slogan of “Jai Jawan, Jai Kisan” and said the slogan had inspired farmers to make India self-reliant in food production.
He expressed hope that “Make in India” would inspire us to become self reliant in all our needs.
The Prime Minister also said the postal and railway networks of India could be leveraged to become drivers of rural development.
The Union Minister for Railways, Shri Suresh Prabhu, was present on the occasion.
The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, has condoled the passing away of senior journalist Shri Jehangir Pocha.
The Prime Minister said he was shocked & saddened to hear about Jehangir Pocha`s demise.
“My condolences to his family in this hour of grief.
May his soul rest in peace.
Jehangir Pocha will be remembered as a leading voice on TV, print & social media.
His frank & insightful views on issues will be missed,” the Prime Minister said.
I am very happy to be here today.
I sense a well-deserved mood of celebration here.
The World Bank has recognized the stupendous work done by us towards improving Ease of Doing Business.
We are now among the top hundred countries in the Doing Business rankings.
In a short time of three years we have improved forty-two ranks.
I thank Ms. Kristalina Georgieva for being with us on this joyous occasion.
It shows World Bank’s commitment to encourage nations to undertake reforms which benefit society and economy.
Her presence today will motivate our team to do even better in the coming days and months.
Over the last three years, I have been constantly telling the domestic and foreign investor community that we in India are making sincere efforts to improve ‘ease of doing business’.
This year, India’s jump in ranking is the highest.
India has been identified as one of the top reformers.
Congratulations to all who have worked for this.
You have done the nation proud.
This improvement is important:
• Because it is an indicator of Good Governance in the Country;
• Because it is a measure of the quality of our public policies;
• Because it is a benchmark of transparency of processes;
• Because, ease of doing business, also leads to ease of life;
• And, ultimately, it reflects the way people live, work and transact in a society.
But all this is for the benefit of concerned stakeholders.
For me, the World Bank report shows that quantum change is possible through commitment and hard work.
I say this because, India has reached a position from where, now it is easier to improve further.
Our efforts have gathered momentum.
In management terms, we have achieved critical mass for a swift takeoff.
For example, this report has not taken into account the implementation of the Goods and Services Tax or GST.
As you all know, GST is the biggest tax reform in the Indian economy.
And it impacts many aspects of doing business.
There are a few other reforms where our team and the World Bank team need to find common ground.
All this, combined with our conviction to do even better, gives me the confidence that India will occupy a place of pride in the World Bank report next year and in the years thereafter.
I compliment the World Bank for engaging with countries to improve ease of doing business across the world.
I also compliment them for the theme of this year’s report – ‘Reforming to create jobs’.
There can be no denying that business is a major force in our lives.
It is an engine for growth, employment generation, wealth creation and delivery of goods and services that make our lives comfortable.
We are a young country and job creation is an opportunity as well as a challenge.
Therefore, to leverage the energy of our youth, we are positioning India as a Start-up Nation and a global manufacturing hub.
For this purpose, we have launched various initiatives, such as Make in India and Start-up India.
Through these initiatives, combined with the new eco-system of a formal economy and a unified tax regime, we are trying to create a NEW INDIA.
An India where opportunities are created and harnessed to the advantage of the needy.
We are particularly keen to develop India into a knowledge based, skill supported and technology driven society.
A good beginning has been made through the Digital India and Skill India initiatives.
India is swiftly changing for the better.
I wish to list some more global recognitions which indicate this:
o We have moved up thirty two places in the last two years in the Global Competitiveness Index of the World Economic Forum.
This is highest for any country;
o We have also moved up twenty one places on the Global Innovation Index of WIPO in two years.
o We have moved nineteen places on the Logistics Performance Index of 2016 of World Bank;
Our mantra is reform, perform and transform.
We want to do better and better.
I am happy to note that for the first time, the World Bank is helping us in this exercise at the sub-National level too.
In a federal democracy like India, it is often not easy to take on board every stakeholder while undertaking reforms.
However, over the last three years, there has been a sea change in the response of Governments, both at Central and State level.
State Governments are finding innovative ways to create a business friendly environment.
While often competing with each other in implementing business reforms, they are also helping each other in implementing them.
This is an exciting universe in which competitiveness and cooperation co-exist.
The agenda for boosting growth and employment, required many structural changes, many tough decisions and many new regulations.
Besides this, the mind-set of the bureaucracy required change to enable them to work fearlessly and honestly.
Over the last three years, the Union Government has done a lot on these fronts.
We have resolved a number of regulatory and policy issues facing businesses and companies.
Alongwith manufacturing, we are also pushing for faster progress in infrastructure sectors.
These reforms have touched significant sectors like Defence, Railways, Construction Development, Insurance, Pension, Civil Aviation and Pharmaceuticals.
This has resulted in increased FDI inflow, which year after year is making new records.
The FDI inflows of 55.6 billion US dollars for the year ending March, 2016 were an all-time high.
The following year, India registered an FDI inflow of 60.08 billion US dollars, thereby scaling an even higher peak.
As a result, the total FDI received in the country has gone up by 67% in a short span of three years.
During the current financial year till August, total FDI of 30.38 billion US dollars has been received, which represents an increase of 30% as compared to the corresponding period last year.
In August, 2017, India received a total FDI of 9.64 billion US dollars, which is the highest ever FDI received in any month.
Over the last three years, we have systemically and critically evaluated business regulations.
We have tried to understand the pain points of businesses with regard to interface with government.
We engaged with businesses on a regular basis, understood their concerns and sought to modify regulation to address their concerns.
I have often emphasized that technology must be used to transform governance.
Use of technology should minimize physical interface and assist time bound decision-making.
I am glad to see that a number of Government Departments and State Governments are deploying technology to improve governance and deliver services.
Alongwith the tools of technology we also need a complete change of mind-set while dealing with business.
Total re-engineering is required both at the level of Mind and Machine.
The past mindset of excessive control has to be replaced by the concept of minimum government, maximum governance.
This is our goal and my Government is determined to achieve this objective.
With this objective, an extensive exercise was undertaken to redesign laws and re-engineer government processes to make business environment simpler and more conducive.
An attempt has been made to align the Indian regulatory environment to international best practices.
Though, we were putting in efforts to improve India’s rank in the Doing Business Report, reforms undertaken by the Government are far more extensive.
To give you one example; we have abolished more than 1200 archaic laws and Acts which were only complicating Governance.
They have been deleted from the statute book.
Similarly, thousands of important reforms have been carried out by the states as well.
These additional efforts are not part of the World Bank’s requirement.
All Ministries of the Central Government, Public Sector Undertakings, State Governments as well as regulators should identify international best practices, consult their stakeholders and align their regulations and processes with international best practices.
I must make a special mention of the fact that while Ease of Doing Business is important for all businesses, it is critical for small businesses including small manufacturers.
This sector provides the bulk of employment in the country and to make them more competitive, we have to reduce the cost of doing business.
The work on Ease of Doing Business must address the issues of these small businesses and manufacturers.
Once again, let me congratulate the team working on various aspects of ease of doing business for their commitment and dedication.
I am sure that together we will write a new chapter in India’s history and transform India so that the dreams and aspirations of our people take wing.
I would like to thank the World Bank again for their guidance in our efforts to improve ease of Doing Business.
I am told that the experience of bringing about decisive changes in a large country like India without affecting the growth process may become an example for many other nations.
There is always scope to learn from others.
If required, we will be happy to share our experience with other countries.
Thank You Very Much !!

The Union Cabinet, chaired by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi, has approved the Hydrocarbon Exploration and Licensing Policy (HELP).
The decision will enhance domestic oil & gas production, bring substantial investment in the sector and generate sizeable employment.
The policy is also aimed at enhancing transparency and reducing administrative discretion.
The uniform licence will enable the contractor to explore conventional as well as unconventional oil and gas resources including CBM, shale gas/oil, tight gas and gas hydrates under a single license.
The concept of Open Acreage Policy will enable E&P companies choose the blocks from the designated area.
Present fiscal system of production sharing based on Investment Multiple and cost recovery /production linked payment will be replaced by a easy to administer revenue sharing model.
The earlier contracts were based on the concept of profit sharing where profits are shared between Government and the contractor after recovery of cost.
Under the profit sharing methodology, it became necessary for the Government to scrutinize cost details of private participants and this led to many delays and disputes.
This is in tune with Government’s policy of “Ease of Doing Business”.
Recognizing the higher risks and costs involved in exploration and production from offshore areas, lower royalty rates for such areas have been provided as compared to NELP royalty rates to encourage exploration and production.
A graded system of royalty rates have been introduced, in which royalty rates decreases from shallow water to deep water and ultra-deep water.
At the same time, royalty rate for on land areas have been kept intact so that revenues to the state governments are not affected.
On the lines of NELP, cess and import duty will not be applicable on blocks awarded under the new policy.
This policy also provides for marketing freedom for crude oil and natural gas produced from these blocks.
This is in tune with Government’s policy of “Minimum Government –Maximum Governance”

The Union Cabinet chaired by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has given its approval for extending the validity of the existing Central Order dated 27.10.2016 in respect of sugar for a further period of six months from 29.04.2017 to 28.10.2017.
The main objective of the decision is to enable the State Governments to issue control order with the prior concurrence of Central Government, for fixing stock limits/licensing requirements in respect of sugar, whenever need is felt by them.
The current decision will be notified by the Government and communicated to all the States/UTs for further action at their end.
The Cabinet in its meeting held on 27.10.2016, decided to enable the States to regulate supply, distribution, sale, production, stock, storage, purchase and movement etc, in respect of sugar for a period up to six months.
The prices of sugar are being monitored by the Department of Food & Public Distribution regularly at factory gate as well as in the domestic market.
In September, 2016 it was noticed that the retail prices had shown a sudden spurt.
The price rise appeared to be more on sentiment than actual shortage.
In order to regulate supply of sugar and address issue of speculative prices, fixing of appropriate stock limit on need basis was essential.
In addition, despite adequate availability of stocks for consumption in the current season, hoarding and consequent profiteering is anticipated due to drop in production over previous year and hence further extension of stock limit would be needed.
Also a performance based production subsidy has been extended @Rs.4.50 per quintal of cane crushed which was directly credited to the farmers account on behalf of sugar mills.
This restricted quantity will help the sugar industry to augment their liquidity and enable them to pay cane dues of farmers.

As such, the pharmaceutical sector in India plays a vital role in managing the public health in large number countries at a substantially lower cost.
The Cabinet has, keeping in view the role of the sector in managing public health, decided that it will not be appropriate to carry out further amendments in the present Act especially as newer areas of biological, stem cells and regenerative medicines, medical devices and clinical trial/investigation, etc. cannot be effectively regulated under the existing law.
The Ministry of Health and Family Welfare has, accordingly, undertaken an exercise at two levels namely (i) to frame separate rules under the existing Act for regulating medical devices; and (ii) to bring out separate legislations for regulating medical devices and Drugs and Cosmetics.

An Indian Expert has been mutually selected by the Government of India and the Government of the Kingdom of Eswatini under the TIWB programme.
The Terms of Reference will formalize the conditions of the engagement of the designated Indian Expert to provide tax assistance to Eswatini under the TIWB Programme.
The engagement of the Indian Expert under the TiWB programme will give impetus to India’s support in capacity building in tax matters in developing countries.
The Tax Inspectors Without Borders (TIWB) Programme which is jointly launched by UNDP and OECD is intended to support developing countries to strengthen national tax administrations through building audit capacity and to share this knowledge with other countries.
The TIWB Programme aims to strengthen tax administrations of developing countries by transferring technical know-how and skills to their tax auditors, and through the sharing of general audit practices and dissemination of knowledge products with them.

India has been supportive in capacity building in tax matters in developing countries.
India being a global leader in this respect has a very important role to play in South-South Cooperation in tax matters.
The Government has accepted the recommendations of the RBI to issue Two thousand rupee notes and new notes of Five hundred rupees will also be placed in circulation.
Notes of one hundred, fifty, twenty, ten, five, two and one rupee will remain legal tender and will remain unaffected by the decision today.
Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi made these important announcements during a televised address to the nation on the evening of Tuesday 8th November 2016.
He said that these decisions will fully protect the interests of honest and hard-working citizens of India and that those five hundred and one thousand rupee notes hoarded by anti-national and anti-social elements will become worthless pieces of paper.

The Prime Minister added that it adversely affects the poor and the neo-middle class people.
He cited the example of the problems being faced by the honest citizens while buying houses.
A time-tested commitment to eradicate black money
The Prime Minister has time and again said that the Government is committed to ensure that the menace of black money is overcome.
Over the past two and a half years of the NDA Government, he has walked the talk and led by example.
The very first decision of the Prime Minister led NDA government was the formation of a SIT on black money.
The efforts have borne fruit.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi has time and again raised the issue of black money at the global forum, including at important multilateral summits and in bilateral meetings with leaders.
India is a preferred destination for investment and India is also an easier place to do business in.

Let us bring the world into our mobile phones!
The youthful energy that our Nation possesses is our prized asset.

Greetings to the Observer countries present here.
This is my first SAARC Summit.
But, this is the second time I am meeting most of you together.
I stepped into the office with the greetings of the entire world.
But, what moved me, dear colleagues, was your personal presence, with the good wishes of one-fourth of humanity.
Because the future I dream for India is the future I wish for our entire region.
The last Summit was three years ago.
Only two of us here were present in Addu.
Even Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina has come here after her re-election.
President Rajapaksa will soon go into one and I wish him good luck.
I especially welcome our newest colleague, President Ghani.
Ours is a region of thriving democracy; of rich inheritance; the unmatched strength of youth; and, a strong thirst for change and progress.
In the last few months, I have travelled around the world.
From the middle of the Pacific, to the southern coast of Atlantic Ocean, I see a rising tide of integration.
And, negotiations on major trade agreements such as Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership, the Trans Pacific Partnership and the Trans Atlantic Trade and Investment Partnership.
Because the barriers of boundaries inhibit progress; international partnerships add speed to it.
Because, in the life of an individual or a Nation, a good neighbourhood is a universal aspiration.
Where does South Asia wish to stand in this world?
Nowhere in the world are collective efforts more urgent than in South Asia; and, nowhere else is it so modest.
Big and small, we face the same challenges- a long climb to the summit of development.
But, I have great belief in our boundless potential; and, confidence – that comes from the many inspiring stories of innovation and initiative in each of our countries.
There is much to learn from each other; even more – to do together.
That was the vision and aspiration that brought us together as SAARC 30 years ago.
We have travelled a long distance together since then.
We have an agreement, an institution or a framework of cooperation in every field.
We also have many successes.
Yet, when we speak of SAARC, we usually hear two reactions – cynicism and scepticism.
This, sadly, is in a region throbbing with the optimism of our youth.
Today, less than 5% of the region’s global trade takes place between us.
Even at this modest level, less than 10% of the region’s internal trade takes place under SAARC Free Trade Area.
It is still harder to travel within our region than to Bangkok or Singapore; and, more expensive to speak to each other.
How much have we done in SAARC to turn our natural wealth into shared prosperity; or, our borders into bridgeheads to a shared future?
Yet, South Asia is slowly coming together.
India and Bangladesh have deepened their links through rail, road, power and transit.
India and Nepal have started a new era of cooperation in energy; and, India and Bhutan are making those ties stronger by the day.
With Sri Lanka, we have transformed trade through a Free Trade Agreement.
We will soon launch a new arrangement to meet Maldives’ need for oil.
Distance and difficulties have not held back India and Afghanistan.
For India, it has been a privilege to provide assistance of nearly 8 billion U.S. dollars in South Asia over a decade.
It may not seem a great amount in these times, but we are grateful for the opportunity to have made a difference to the lives of a few brothers and sisters in our region.
Each of us has taken our own initiatives.
However, as SAARC we have failed to move with the speed that our people expect and want.
Some argue that it is because of the region’s development gap.
But, that should actually spur us to do more.
Or, is it because we are stuck behind the walls of our differences and hesitant to move out of the shadows of the past?
This won’t resolve our differences, but will certainly deprive us of opportunities.
Today, goods travel from one Punjab to the other Punjab through Delhi, Mumbai, Dubai and Karachi – making the journey eleven times longer and the cost four times more.
India, too, has its share of responsibility –because of our size and location.
I know that many of your goods, too, have to do a Parikrama of India to reach their destinations.
Just think of what we are doing to our consumers – and to our environment!
We must shrink the distance between our producers and consumers and use the most direct routes of trade.
I know India has to lead, and we will do our part.
I hope, each of you will, too.
Infrastructure is our region’s greatest weakness and it’s most pressing need.
When I thought of coming to Kathmandu by road, it made many officials in India nervous.
Because of the condition of roads at the border!
We speak of ease of doing business in India.
Let’s extend this to our region.
I promise to ensure that our facilities at the border will speed up, not slow down, trade.
Let’s all make our procedures simple, our facilities better, our standards common and our paper work less burdensome.
India will now give business visa for 3-5 years for SAARC.
Let`s make it even easier for our businesses through a SAARC Business Traveller Card.
Excellencies, India has a huge trade surplus with SAARC countries.
I believe that this neither right nor sustainable.
We will address your concerns and give you a level playing field in India.
But, I encourage you to attract Indian investments to produce for the Indian market and create jobs for your youth.
I also look to a future when your companies can easily raise funds in India for investments at home; and, when we have cross-border industrial corridors, so that we can take advantage of the natural synergies and connected lives in our Border States.
I also believe that if we can light up each other’s towns and villages, we can build a brighter tomorrow for our region.
Or, face a future when someone looks down at us from Space, and says that this is world`s darkest corner.
Let us treat electricity as a commodity like any other that we invest and trade in.
India will fully support these initiatives in the region.
We should also think with ambition to use solar energy and micro grids to quickly provide clean power to villages across the region.
Our relations become stronger when we connect the lives of the ordinary citizens of our countries.
That is why connectivity and services by rail and road are so important.
We should also connect ourselves more by air.
We could begin with the Buddhist circuit, but we don’t have to stop there.
As we seek to build bridges to prosperity, we must not lose sight of our responsibility to the millions living without hope.
We must work with our compassion of our hearts, but also with the power of science.
In the area of health, India will meet the shortfall in funds to establish the SAARC Regional Supra Reference Laboratory for TB and HIV.
We offer the five-in-one vaccine for the children of South Asia.
Information technology has removed all barriers to quality education.
India is prepared to connect our South Asian students through online course and E-libraries.
When we set up India’s National Knowledge Network, we will be happy to extend it to the SAARC region.
India’s gift of a satellite for the SAARC region will benefit us all in areas like education, telemedicine, disaster response, resource management, weather forecasting and communication.
We will also host a conference in India for all South Asian partners next year, to strengthen our collective ability to apply space technology in economic development and governance.
And, we plan to launch our satellite by the SAARC Day in 2016.
As neighbours, we should also be together in good and bad times.
India’s capability and expertise in disaster management will always be available to South Asia.
Equally, as we reach out to Indians caught in conflicts and disasters around the world, we will also be there for all our South Asian citizens.
Excellencies, a prosperous SAARC needs the strong foundation of a secure South Asia.
If we are sensitive to each other’s security, and the lives of our people, we will deepen friendships, spur cooperation and advance stability in our region.
Today, as we remember the horror of the terror attack in Mumbai in 2008, we feel the endless pain of lost lives.
Let us work together to fulfil the pledge we have taken to combat terrorism and trans-national crimes.
The bonds will grow.
Through SAARC or outside it.
Among us all or some of us.
We can all choose our paths to our destinations.
But, when we join our hands and walk in step, the path becomes easier, the journey quicker and the destination closer.
I say this as much to my government and people, as I say to you.
Today, it is calling us to act.
Let us work to change cynicism into optimism.
Let us turn South Asia of flowering hope into a rich field of peace and prosperity.

I am happy to join you today, through Video Conferencing, at the Annual International Yoga Festival.
On 11th February, they successfully tested a high altitude ballistic missile shield, which can provide effective security cover to our cities, against missile attacks.
Yesterday, they added another feather in their cap by successfully testing a low altitude interceptor missile.
This is a capability that only four other nations currently possess.
I congratulate our space and defence scientists for their achievements.
We in India believe in researching both the frontiers of science and technology, as also, researching deep within our souls, that is, both Science, and Yoga.
Perhaps, there can be no better place than Rishikesh, to host the International Yoga Festival.
This, indeed, is a place that has drawn sages, pilgrims, commoners and celebrities alike, over millennia, in quest for peace, and for the true essence of Yoga.
“If I were asked under what sky the human mind has most fully developed some of its choicest gifts, has most deeply pondered on the greatest problems of life, and has found solutions, I should point to India.”
From Max Muller, to many of you present in Rishikesh today – all immensely successful people in their own right – whenever the quest to know one’s real self has beckoned, their destination has been India.
And in most cases, that quest, has led them, to Yoga.
It expands our limited sense of self, to see our families, societies and mankind, as extensions of our own self.
This journey, as a natural by-product, brings the added benefits of good health, peace of mind, and even, prosperity in life.
It would be very unfair to see Yoga only as a set of exercises that keeps the body fit.
Yoga offers a timeless, simple, and healthy alternative.
There is ample evidence that practicing yoga helps combat stress and chronic lifestyle-related conditions.
When we talk of global peace, there should be peace among nations.
That is possible only when there is peace within the society.
Only peaceful families can constitute peaceful society.
Only peaceful individuals can make peaceful families.
Yoga is the way to create such a harmony and peace within individuals, family, society, nation and ultimately all over the world.
When we talk of combating climate change, we seek to move away from a lifestyle of consumption, or “Bhoga”, to one of Yoga.
At a time, when emphasis is on personal gain, and what one may get out of any endeavour, Yoga offers a refreshingly different approach.
Yoga is not about what one can get out of it.
It is rather about what one can give up, what one can get rid of.
Therefore, instead of attainment, Yoga shows us the path to liberation, or Mukti, as we call it in this part of the world.
Swami Chidanand Saraswati ji, through his work at Parmarth Niketan has shown a way to live these noble ideals.
I appreciate the work being done by Parmarth Niketan in bringing Yoga to people across the world.
I recall the active role played by Swami ji, in compiling the 11 volume Encyclopaedia of Hinduism.
Remarkably, Swamiji and his team have accomplished this mission in less than a quarter of a century.
And the depth of their work is amazing.
This increased under-standing, in turn, reduces hatred, misunderstanding and increases cooperation, peace and amity among communities.
Let me also take this opportunity, to compliment Parmarth Niketan, for the active role played by them in the Swachh Bharat Mission – a mass movement towards Clean India.
Indian traditions lay a strong emphasis on personal hygiene.
Not only is keeping one’s body clean and pure emphasized, but also cleanliness in one’s house, place of work and place of worship is given a lot of priority.
There is, however, a tendency to dump dirt in open spaces.
This is not true for western and other developed countries, where the link between community hygiene and public health is more clearly understood.
Awareness and observance of hygiene of public goods like water bodies, land and air is crucial.
Through the Swachh Bharat Mission, we are attempting to establish the link between community hygiene and personal health.
However, with passage of time, they were surrounded by markets, and residential colonies.
And hence, they face unclean surroundings as a major challenge.
In the first phase, we have taken Kamakhya Temple, Jagannath Puri, Meenakshi Temple, Tirupati, Golden Temple, and Vaishno Devi temple for making them and their surroundings clean.
We were all witness to the great global upsurge for Yoga when, in September 2014, I proposed an International Day of Yoga, at the session of the General Assembly of the United Nations.
And now, every year, on the occasion of Summer Solstice – June 21 – the world comes together, for Yoga.
Yoga has the potential to herald in a new Yuga (a new era) – a Yuga of peace, compassion, brotherhood and all-round progress of the human race.
Ladies and Gentlemen,
May you find fulfilment and bliss, in this great festival of Yoga, on the banks of the River Ganga, where our sages and rishis have meditated for millennia.
I wish the International Yoga Festival a grand success.

He said the workshop should also focus on reforms in laws related to urban development.
The Prime Minister called for identifying parameters that could be laid down for smart cities.
He asked officials to identify the basics of infrastructure, quality of life, and citizen-centric services that would be essential to cities of the 21st century.
He said cities should be identified as hubs of economic activity.
He said focus on “waste to wealth” – i.e. – solid-waste management, and waste-water treatment would be an important part of the development of smart cities.
The Prime Minister asked Government officials to visualize “urban-dependent” population, in addition to “urban” population, while planning for Smart Cities.
Officials from the Prime Minister’s Office, Ministry of Urban Development, and Ministry of Information Technology, were present on the occasion.
My Ministerial colleagues, Shri Prakash Javadekarji, Shri Piyush Goyalji, Distinguished guests.
I am delighted to inaugurate the Indian Pavilion.
This is the first day of a historic summit in Paris.
We stand here in solidarity with Paris and France and in admiration for their resolve and courage.
The entire world, 196 Nations, have come together to shape the future of this world and the health of our planet.
This summit is of great significance to India’s future, too.
This pavilion is a window to our heritage and our progress; our traditions and our technology; our aspirations and our achievements.
India’s new economic momentum is a subject of international attention and a source of global opportunity.
Our progress will not just change the lives of one-sixth of humanity.
It will also mean a more successful and prosperous world.
Equally, the choices the world makes here will have an impact on our development.
Climate change is a major global challenge.
But, climate change is not of our making.
It is the result of global warming that came from the prosperity and progress of an industrial age powered by fossil fuel.
But, we in India face its consequences today.
We see it in the risks of our farmers, the changes in weather patterns, and the intensity of natural disasters.
That is why the outcome in Paris so important.
That is why we are here.
We want the world to act with urgency.
We want a comprehensive, equitable and durable agreement, which must lead us to restore the balance between humanity and Nature and between what we have inherited and what we will leave behind.
This will mean a partnership in which those who have the luxury of choices and the capability of technology will make adjustments to sharply reduce their carbon emission.
The extent of their commitment and the strength of their action must be consistent with the carbon space they occupy.
And, they must leave enough of what is left of our carbon space to let developing countries grow.
They should share resources and technology with those who live between want and hope, so that we can meet the universal aspiration for clean energy.
It will also mean that the developing world will also try to have a lighter carbon footprint on their growth path.
We want the conviction of the world to be matched by efforts to create conditions in which we can succeed.
I am here in the Indian Pavilion to say something else.
And, I speak not just to the world, but also to our people.
India’s progress is our destiny and the right of our people.
But, we are a Nation that must also lead in combating climate change.
It stems from our obligation to give our people clean air; clean rivers; resilient farms; healthy habitats; and, forests rich with life.
It comes from our conviction that we must aim not just for higher incomes, but better quality of life.
It comes from our commitment to the world.
Above all, it arises, from our timeless traditions and beliefs.
The choices a people make are shaped by their culture and beliefs.
In India, Nature has always been treated as Mother.
Since ancient times, we have seen humanity as part of Nature, not superior to it.
So, Nature is meant to provide and nurture, not to exploit.
When Nature is in equilibrium, our lives and our world will be in balance.
This is what we learn from Kshetrapati Sukta in our Rig Veda.
This is why Atharva-Veda calls it a bounden duty that we must protect the Earth so that Life can be sustained.
This is what we have tried to capture in the publication PARAMPARA that we have released today.
This is why recycling and conservation comes naturally to us.
And, why we have sacred groves across our Nation.
And, it is this spirit that leads us to set an ambitious and comprehensive strategy to combat climate change.
We have a target for renewable generation of 175 Gigawatt by 2022.
Like cellular phones before, we can use renewable energy to bring power to our 18000 unconnected villages quickly and cleanly.
By 2030, 40% of our installed capacity will be based on non-fossil fuel.
We will convert waste to energy.
We are investing in supercritical technology in thermal plants.
We have imposed tax on coal and reduced subsidies on petroleum products.
We are raising fuel standards for automobiles.
And, we have introduced tax free bonds for renewable energy.
We have a massive programme to expand our forest cover and protect our biodiversity.
Our vision of India as a global manufacturing hub rests on the simple principle of “zero defect, zero effect” – production that is perfect and leaves no footprint on environment.
And, research and innovation in clean energy is a high priority.
We want to make conventional energy, like coal, cleaner.
We will make renewable energy cheaper and convenient to install even in our homes.
We want to make it more reliable and easier to feed into our transmission lines.
From governments to communities, there are countless examples of innovation and enterprise that are restoring the health of our environment.
I have tried to capture some of these initiatives in my book, Convenient Action, which we shall present today.
This is the voice of our people, the call of our Nation and the consensus of our polity.
India’s leadership on environment has been the vision of Indian leaders and successive governments – from Stockholm in 1975 to Copenhagen in 2009.
Later today, I will join leaders from major developed and developing world for an innovation summit; because I believe that innovation and technology hold the key to our collective success.
President Hollande and I will also co-chair the launch of my long cherished dream of an international solar alliance to promote greater use of solar energy in the 121 solar-rich Nations.
And, I will also call for a change in lifestyles, so that we reduce the burden on our planet.
For, the enduring success of our efforts will depend on the way we live and think.
The desire for well being should include our planet, our Nature, all countries and the entire humanity.
If our thinking is right, we will form a true global partnership of capabilities and needs that leads us to a low carbon age.
The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, was today presented with a unique artwork made of pearls.
The artwork depicts a map of India, and an image of the Prime Minister.
According to the creator of the image, Ms. Khushboo Akash Davda, over five lakh pearls have been used in the artwork.
Thread of length 10 kilometres has been used in the same.
The artwork which has dimensions of 7 feet by 7 feet, took 850 hours to prepare.
Member of Parliament from Rajkot, Shri Mohanbhai Kundariya was present on the occasion.
The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi has saluted the brave CRPF personnel who were martyred in the attack in Sukma, Chhattisgarh.
“India salutes the brave CRPF personnel who were martyred in the attack in Sukma, Chhattisgarh.
My thoughts are with the families and friends of the brave martyrs.
The nation stands shoulder to shoulder with them in this hour of grief”, the Prime Minister said.
It is a great honour to participate in the Indian Science Congress.
I thank University of Mumbai for hosting this Congress.
I had the opportunity to participate in the Congress as Chief Minister of Gujarat.
I am delighted to return here after ten years.
I greatly admire the rich history of this hundred-year old institution.
Human civilization has advanced because of the basic human spirit of enquiry and quest for understanding our universe and world.
We have here with us Nobel Laureates, whose work in science has given new hope against dreaded diseases.
We also have one whose own understanding of social science gave the poorest a life of hope, opportunity and dignity.
Science and technology has helped reduce poverty and advance prosperity; fight hunger and improve nutrition; conquer diseases, improve health and give a child a better chance to survive; connect us to our loved ones and the world; spread education and awareness; and, given us clean energy that can make our habitat more sustainable.
A Nation’s progress and its human development are linked to science and technology.
In more recent times, China’s emergence as the second biggest global economy is in parallel to its rise to the second place in science and technology activities.
Science and technology can also remove national barriers, unify the world and advance peace.
It can bring nations, rich and poor, in a shared effort to address global challenges.
But, we also know that it can increase inequality, make wars more lethal and damage our environment.
Sometimes, we learn about their consequences later, as we did on climate change; sometimes, these are the result of our own choices.
For example, information technology was meant to increase efficiency and productivity; sometimes, however, its various distractions can easily overpower us!
How often do we sit in meetings and cannot resist the temptation to catch up on our messages!
So, when we speak of science and human development, we cannot divorce it from the questions of political decisions; social choices; and of equity, ethics and access.
At the dawn of freedom, Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru placed science and technology at the heart of national development.
Our scientists launched pioneering research and built outstanding institutions with modest resources that continue to serve us well.
Since then, our scientists have placed us at the forefront of the world in many areas.
Whenever the world shut its door on us, our scientists responded with the zeal of a national mission.
When the world sought our collaboration, they reached out with the openness that is inherent in our society.
They have alleviated some of our most acute and pressing challenges of human development.
They helped us overcome dependence on others for such basic needs as food.
They have secured our borders; supported industrial progress; and, given our people a life of opportunities and dignity.
Our achievements give us pride, but they do not blind us to the enormous challenges that we face in India.
We are at yet another moment of expectation and excitement, as we were at the birth of independent India.
There is a mood of optimism for change in the country; the energy to pursue it; and, confidence to achieve it.
This is an enterprise of national importance in which each of us – Government, Industry, National Laboratories, Universities and research institutions – have to work together.
But, our own achievements have shown that very often a need and vision and passion are more important than resource for success.
And, it is how we use resources that will determine how effective we are in making science and technology work for us.
Our development challenges will naturally shape our strategic priorities in science and technology.
Even as we focus on some key areas, we should not confine research and development to a few pre-determined paths.
And, it is as important to focus on basic research as on research and development and innovation.
We should also recognize that science is universal, but technology can be local.
If we incorporate traditional and local knowledge, systems and technologies, we may develop more appropriate, effective, affordable and sustainable solutions that contribute immensely to human development and progress.
As the major source of science and technology efforts in the country, Government must do its part.
When I speak of ease of doing business in India, I also want to pay equal attention to the ease of doing research and development in India.
Funding proposals must not take too long to clear; meeting application requirement should not become more complex than research; approval process should not become a deterrent for international conference; and, our scientific departments must have flexibility of funding decisions based on the uncertainties inherent in research activities.
We want our scientists and researchers to explore the mysteries of science, not of government procedures.
We want them to consider publications, not government approvals, to be the epitome of their success.
We must also have clear regulatory policies for research and development in areas like biotechnology, Nano-Science, agriculture and clinical research.
We should ensure that our strong intellectual property regime continues to work effectively and provides the right balance between private incentives and social good.
We have begun this experience with Space technology.
Investments in science and technology activities should also become part of the expenditure on corporate social responsibility – to be funded directly or through an autonomous fund.
We also need to foster a strong culture of collaboration between institutions and across disciplines to take advantage of developments, innovations and expertise in diverse areas.
My impression is that this is far from the ideal in India.
I will ask our ministries to make collaborations a critical requirement for their institutions and for supporting funding requests for research.
Our universities must be freed from the clutches of excessive regulation and cumbersome procedures.
They must have a higher degree of academic freedom and autonomy; and, there should be as much emphasis on research as on teaching.
We have to rapidly expand our higher education sector; yet, our existing institutions face shortage of faculty.
Our industry must also step up investments in science and technology in its own interest.
India’s own pharmaceutical industry has carved out a place for itself in the world, because it invests significantly in research.
Indeed, our long term global competitiveness will depend not on replicating what others have done, but through a process of sustained development and innovation.
There is a growing trend of international collaboration in research and development, not just among business enterprises, but equally among researchers and scholars at universities and laboratories.
We should take full advantage of this.
For this reason, I have placed science and technology at the forefront of our diplomatic engagement.
As I have travelled abroad, I have personally sought out scientists to explore collaborations in areas like clean energy, agriculture, biotechnology, medicine and healthcare.
School education in science and mathematics should become more creative and stimulating.
I welcome the initiatives of Department of Science and Technology for involving thousands of children and youth in science and technology.
It is not surprising that our young minds are winning international competitions and 12 of them have minor comets named after them!
Our children should seek role model in scientists as much as in sportsmen.
We should give young participants and winners in science fairs maximum public recognition and sustained support of the government.
I would personally love to meet the best of our young scientists.
In conclusion, let me say for a safe, sustainable, prosperous future for India; or global leadership in a knowledge and technology intensive world, we need to put science, technology and innovation at the top of national priorities.
I am confident that we can do it.
We in India are the inheritors of a thriving tradition of Indian science and technology since ancient times.
Mathematics and medicine; metallurgy and mining; calculus and textiles; architecture and astronomy – the contribution the Indian civilization to human knowledge and advancement has been rich and varied.
Thank you very much, wish you all the best.
Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi today received Mr. John Baird, Foreign Minister of Canada and Mr. Ed Fast, Minister of International Trade of Canada.
The Prime Minister welcomed close cooperation between India and Canada and expressed satisfaction at comprehensive nature of bilateral ties, including in areas of economic cooperation, agriculture, security, civil nuclear energy, education, and science and technology.
The Prime Minister called for strengthening bilateral engagement in the areas of trade and investment, energy, healthcare, infrastructure development and people-to-people contacts.
Mr. Baird conveyed the commitment of the Government of Canada under Prime Minister Harper to further strengthen the Strategic Partnership with India and extended an invitation to the Prime Minister to visit Canada.
Mr. Ed Fast also sought earlier conclusion of Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement and Bilateral Investment Promotion and Protection Agreement between the two countries.
The Prime Minister thanked Mr. Baird for Prime Minister Harper’s invitation and said that he looked forward to visiting Canada at mutually convenient date.
The Prime Minister also said that he looked forward to meeting Prime Minister Harper at the G-20 Summit in Brisbane, Australia, in November 2014.
The Union Cabinet chaired by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has given its approval for signing of a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) between India and Morocco on cooperation in the field of health.
iii) Communicable Diseases;
A Working Group will be set up to further elaborate the details of cooperation and to oversee the implementation of this MoU.
Estate Officers can even make an order for the eviction of such persons forthwith following the procedure proposed in the new section.
The amendment will thus facilitate smooth and speedy eviction of unauthorised occupants from government residences.
As a consequence to these amendments, Government of India can now ensure that the unauthorised occupants are evicted from government residence in a speedy and smooth manner and the vacated accommodations are made available to eligible Govt. employees thus reducing the waiting period.
The beneficiaries include the employees of the Central Government offices who are eligible for General Pool Residential Accommodation (GPRA) and waiting for the maturity of their turn.
The Government of India has to evict unauthorized occupants from Government accommodations under the provisions of PPE Act, 1971.
However, the eviction proceedings take unusually long time, thereby reducing the availability of govt. accommodations to new incumbents.
The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, today met and interacted with the winners of the Pradhan Mantri Rashtriya Bal Puraskar 2019.
The children explained in detail, their special achievements, and shared their inspirational stories.
The Prime Minister appreciated and congratulated the award winners for their achievements.
He said that these awards offer an opportunity for recognition of talented children, and serve as inspiration for others like them.
The Prime Minister urged the extra-ordinarily gifted children to stay connected with nature.
He shared some light and informal moments with the children who also requested him for autographs.
A total of 783 applications were received for the Bal Shakti Puraskar this year.
The Ministry for Women and Child Development selected 26 awardees for Bal Shakti Puraskar, under the category of innovation, scholastic, sports, arts & culture, social service and bravery.
The National Selection Committee also finalized the names of 2 individuals and 3 institutions for Bal Kalyan Puraskar.
President of CPAFFC Madame Li Xiaolin,
Hon’ble Chief Ministers, Governors and Mayors,
This is a historic moment in the relationship between India and China.
Today, we are launching a new vehicle for advancing cooperation between our two countries.
In times to come, this will become one of the most important instruments for deepening our economic partnership and contact between our people.
As someone who has been Chief Minister for thirteen years and Prime Minister for one, this forum has a special place in my heart.
But, it is not just my sentiments that lead me to give such importance to this new institution.
It comes from a serious conviction, born from my experience, that states have a vital role to play in the national development.
This is especially true for large and populous countries, with a high degree of geographical, social and economic diversity.
It becomes even more relevant, when the constitutional and political systems are federal in structure.
These attributes exist in both India and China, the world’s two most populous nations.
In India’s Constitution, state governments have predominant role in economic and social development.
The Central Government creates the macro-economic environment.
It can set the broad social and economic agenda and directions for the nation.
It can launch development policies and schemes.
It can manage resources.
But, in the end, the state governments have an important role in their implementation.
But, as I saw in my own experience, state governments can take innumerable initiatives for the development of the states.
That is the level of autonomy and responsibility that they enjoy under our Constitution.
In the same national environment, states are performing at different levels.
For business investors, too, whether they are Indian or foreign, their journey may begin in Delhi, but their success ultimately depends on state capitals.
Many of the critical requirements for success – infrastructure, land, utilities, skilled human resources and many approvals –ultimately depend on the state governments.
But, for me, the involvement of states in our national effort is not just because of their constitutional and legal responsibilities.
It is also stems from a basic management principle.
The chances of success are higher when we create a sense of participation for everyone; when we give everyone a stake in success.
That is why I speak of Team India.
That is why I believe that the foundation for India’s development will not be the single pillar of the Central Government, but 30 pillars comprising the Central Government and all our States.
It follows from the simple logic of science that this foundation will be stronger and more stable.
It can support a much taller structure of development.
That is why I speak of Cooperative Federalism, when the Centre and the States are partners.
I also speak of cooperative and competitive federalism, in which states compete with each other to attract investments and jobs.
We have moved quickly in the past year to give shape to this vision.
When we replaced the old Planning Commission with the institution called Niti Ayog, we gave a formal place and role for state governments in an institution of this nature for the first time in India.
We have radically increased the amount of resources that the Central Government must transfer to the state governments.
And, when we began to raise large revenues from the auction of our coal, it also filled the coffers of the states where the mines are located.
I am asking my ministries to move conferences out of Delhi to state capitals and other cities, so that they do get the benefits that come from hosting such events.
More than anything else, we deal with the state governments in a spirit of partnership and with sensitivity to their concerns.
And, in doing so, we do not look at the symbol of the political party that is in power in the state.
Which is why, when I invited state governments to participate in this event, I did considered the linkages of their states with China, but also broader political representation.
Every nation needs strong international partnerships for its progress.
The linkage has deepened in an integrated world.
As international partnerships in trade, investments, innovation, technology, tourism, education, skills and health grow, state governments have a stake in them and responsibility for their success.
I have found, both through outbound and inbound state delegations, that state level interactions can be often more focused and productive.
A number of decisions can be taken quickly by the state governments.
These interactions also make the state governments more sensitive and aware of the international dynamics and requirements.
Therefore, I attach great significance to this forum.
It is the first that India has with any country.
And, it is appropriate that it has started with China.
We are two of the world’s largest economies and among its fastest growing major economies.
We have enormous economic synergies.
We also face similar challenges.
We have some similar experiences.
We have both seen differences in the pace of development in different parts of our countries.
Our economic relations are growing rapidly.
During President Xi’s visit last year, we set for ourselves an ambitious plan to take our economic relations to a new level.
We agreed on China setting up two industrial parks in India – in Maharashtra and Gujarat.
We are pleased that both Chief Ministers are here.
We have agreed on cooperation in the upgrading of India’s railway sector.
I have invited Chinese companies to invest in India’s manufacturing sector.
President Xi spoke of 20 billion dollars of Chinese investments over the next five years.
Some of the business agreements will take shape in Shanghai tomorrow.
I believe it will be much easier to translate our vision into reality, if provincial and state governments come into closer contacts.
It will also serve our other interests – especially promoting greater people-to-people contacts, which is at the heart of all relationships.
Between India and China, we already have sister-state relationships between Gujarat and Guangdong.
We also have a number of sister-city relations.
During this visit, we will see the launch of Karnataka Sichuan relations and four sister-city relationships.
It is also consistent with this spirit that President Xi began his visit to India in Ahmedabad and I started this visit in Xian.
These are welcome developments.
We are truly taking our relationship outside our national capitals to state capitals and cities.
So, it is a great pleasure for me to join Premier Li in launching this forum.
“Jan Mann” (People’s attitude) has changed in India
Development is the solution to all problems India faces
Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, today said a change has occurred in the “Jan Mann” (people’s attitude) in India.
Addressing a large gathering of the Indian community in Toronto, Canada, the Prime Minister illustrated how changing attitudes were bringing about positive developments in India.
He said bank officers had worked hard, and approached the underprivileged, unbanked sections of society, to ensure that 14 crore new bank accounts were opened under the Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana.
The Prime Minister said development is the cure to all problems faced by India.
He spoke of his Government’s vision and emphasis on skill development, and the importance of instilling a sense of “dignity of labour” in India.
He added that this would ensure that India can become a major global supplier of skilled manpower.
He said India needed to produce job-creators, not job seekers.
The Prime Minister spoke of the MoU signed with France, that would allow components of nuclear power plants to be built in India.
He said those power plants could perhaps, one day, be energized using Uranium that would come from Canada.
He said this was a big step in enhancing clean energy production in India.
This would enable one-sixth of humanity to make a contribution to protect the environment, he added.
The Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has approved an ex- gratia of Rs. 2 lakh each for the next of kin of those who have lost their lives due to a building collapse in Ghatkopar, Mumbai.
The Prime Minister has also approved Rs. 50,000 each for those injured due to the building collapse.
The Union Cabinet, chaired by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi, has approved setting up of six new Indian Institutes of Technology (IITs) in Andhra Pradesh, Chhatisgarh, Goa, Jammu, Kerala and Karnataka.
The Cabinet further gave its approval for operationalisation of these IITs initially by forming of Societies under the Societies Registration Act, 1860 in order to give a legal status to them till the amendment for their incorporation in The Institutes of Technology Act, 1961 is enacted.
The Union Cabinet chaired by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has given its approval to carry out official amendments in “The National Waterways Bill, 2015”.
The amendments are based on the recommendations of the Department related Parliamentary Standing Committee on Transport, Tourism and Culture and comments of State Governments.
It provides for enacting a Central Legislation to declare 106 additional inland waterways, as the National waterways.
After the inclusion of 106 additional inlands waterways to the existing five National waterways, the total number of National waterways goes upto 111.
Declaration of the above additional 106 waterways as National Waterways would not have any immediate financial implications.
Financial approval of the competent authority for each waterway would, however, be taken based on the outcome of the techno-economic feasibility studies etc. that are being undertaken by the Inland Waterways Authority of India (IWAI) currently.
IWAI will develop the feasible stretch of National Waterways for shipping and navigation purpose through mobilization of financial resources.
The declaration of these National Waterways would enable IWAI to develop the feasible stretches for Shipping and Navigation.
The right over the use of water, river bed and the appurtenant land will remain with the State Government.
In addition, other benefits to States are: fewer accidents, less congestion on roads, cheaper mode of ferrying passengers, reduced logistics costs in cargo movement and development of adjoining areas.
The expeditious declaration of National Waterways and its subsequent development will enhance the industrial growth and tourism potential of the hinterland along the waterway.
This will also provide an additional, cheaper and environment friendly mode of transportation throughout the country.
Inland Water Transport is considered as the most cost effective and economical mode of transport from the point of view of fuel efficiency.
One horse power can carry 4000 Kg load in water whereas, it can carry 150 Kg and 500 Kg by road and rail respectively.
Further in a study as highlighted by the World Bank, 1 litre of fuel can move 105 ton-Km by inland water transport, whereas the same amount of fuel can move only 85 ton-Km by rail and 24 ton-Km by road.
Studies have shown that emission from container vessels range from 32-36 gCO2 per ton-Km while those of road transport vehicles (heavy duty vehicles) range from 51-91gCO2 per ton-km.
Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, has said that he is appalled at the news of a Temple being built in his name.
“Have seen the news about a Temple being built in my name.
I was appalled.
This is shocking and against India`s great traditions.
Building such Temples is not what our culture teaches us.
Personally, it made me very sad.
Would urge those doing it not to do it.
If you have time and resources, please devote the same towards fulfilling our dream of a Clean India,” the Prime Minister said.
The Union Cabinet, chaired by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi, today approved the “Stand Up India Scheme” to promote entrepreneurship among SC/ST and Women entrepreneurs.
The expected date of reaching the target of at least 2.5 lakh approvals is 36 months from the launch of the Scheme.
The Stand Up India Scheme provides for:
• Refinance window through Small Industries Development Bank of India (SIDBI) with an initial amount of Rs. 10,000 crore.
• Creation of a credit guarantee mechanism through the National Credit Guarantee Trustee Company (NCGTC).
• Handholding support for borrowers both at the pre loan stage and during operations.
This would include increasing their familiarity with factoring services, registration with online platforms and e-market places as well as sessions on best practices and problem solving.
The details of the scheme are as follows:
• Focus is on handholding support for both SC/ST and Women borrowers.
The Union Cabinet, chaired by the Prime Minister Narendra Modi has approved promulgation of an Ordinance for establishing the New Delhi International Arbitration Centre (NDIAC) for the purpose of creating an independent and autonomous regime for institutionalised arbitration.
The benefits of institutionalized arbitration will accrue to Government and its agency and to the parties to a dispute.
This shall be to the advantage of the public and the public institutions in terms of quality of expertise and costs incurred and will facilitate India becoming a hub for Institutional Arbitration.
The NDAIC shall be established with an aim to:-
(a) to bring targeted reforms to develop itself as a flagship institution for conducting international and domestic arbitration
(b) provide facilities and administrative assistance for conciliation mediation and arbitral proceedings;
(c) maintain panels of accredited arbitrators, conciliators and mediators both at national and international level or specialists such as surveyors and investigators;
(d) facilitate conducting of international and domestic arbitrations and conciliation in the most professional manner;
(e) provide cost effective and timely services for the conduct of arbitrations and conciliations at Domestic and International level;
(f) promote studies in the field of alternative dispute resolution and related matters, and to promote reforms in the system of settlement of disputes; and
(g) co-operate with other societies, institutions and organisations, national or international for promoting alternative dispute resolution.
In order to facilitate the setting up of NDIAC, the Ordinance envisages the transfer and vesting of the undertakings of the ICADR in the Central Government.
The Central Government will subsequently vest the undertakings in NDIAC.
There will be two Full time or Part time Members from amongst eminent persons having substantial knowledge and experience in institutional arbitration, both domestic and international.
Also, one representative of a recognised body of commerce and industry shall be chosen on rotational basis as Part time Member.
President Hollande, Excellencies,
The pain of Paris is yet to heal.
So, I speak in admiration for your resilience and resolve.
And, I salute the world for standing, in full strength, with France and Paris.
Over the next few days, we will decide the fate of this planet.
We do so when the consequences of the industrial age powered by fossil fuel are evident, especially on the lives of the poor.
The prosperous still have a strong carbon footprint.
And, the world’s billions at the bottom of the development ladder are seeking space to grow.
So, the choices are not easy.
But, we have awareness and technology.
We need now national will and a genuine global partnership.
We will enlarge our forest cover to absorb at least 2.5 billion tonnes worth of carbon dioxide.
We hope advanced nations will assume ambitious targets and pursue them sincerely.
It is not just a question of historical responsibility.
They also have the most room to make the cuts and make the strongest impact.
And, climate justice demands that, with the little carbon space we still have, developing countries should have enough scope to grow.
The principles of equity and common but differentiated responsibilities must remain the bedrock of our collective enterprise across all areas – mitigation, adaptation and means for implementation.
Anything else would be morally wrong; and disparities.
Equity means that national commitments must be consistent with the carbon space nations occupy.
We also need a strong Agreement on Adaptation and Loss and Damage.
They must fulfill their commitment in a credible, transparent and meaningful manner.
Energy is a basic human need.
For this, we need to scale up Green Climate Fund that will improve access to technology and intellectual property.
We still need conventional energy.
We should make it clean, not impose an end to its use.
And, there should be no place for unilateral steps that become economic barriers for others.
We welcome stocktaking that is transparent, covers both support and commitments, and based on differentiation.
The presence of 196 countries tells us that we have a chance to unite behind a common purpose.
I am confident that we will.
The Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi congratulated ISRO scientists on the successful launch of IRNSS1F into the orbit.
“Successful launch of IRNSS-1F is an accomplishment we all take immense pride in.
I salute the hardwork of our scientists & ISRO”, the Prime Minister said.
The Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi spoke on the telephone with Mr. Pravind Kumar Jugnauth a short while ago to congratulate him on his assumption of office as the Prime Minister of Mauritius.
Prime Minister Jugnauth thanked the Prime Minister for the telephone call.
The Prime Minister also appreciated the leadership and contribution of outgoing Prime Minister Sir Anerood Jugnauth to strengthening the strong bonds of friendship between India and Mauritius.
The project will reduce the distance from Salsalabari and Alipurduar to Siliguri by nearly 50 km.
This is significant as better access to Siliguri means better access to railways and airways.
The National Highway will facilitate better movement of tea and other agricultural produce from the region to markets.
The improved connectivity will also lead to an increase in tourism in the region.
The National Highway will incorporate all necessary safety features to provide relief to road users.
There will be 3 Railway Over Bridges, 2 Flyovers, 3 Vehicular Underpasses, 8 Major Bridges and 17 Minor Bridges on this section of National Highway.

The Union Cabinet, chaired by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has given ex-post facto approval for amendment to the ‘Framework on Currency Swap Arrangement for SAARC Member Countries’ to incorporate a ‘Standby Swap’ amounting to USD 400 million operated within the overall size of the Facility of USD 2 billion and build in flexibility with respect to modalities of its operation, such as period of swap, roll over, etc. after due consideration of conditions of requesting SAARC member countries and domestic requirements of India.
Due to heightened financial risk and volatility in global economy, short term swap requirements of SAARC countries could be higher than the agreed lines.
The incorporation of ‘Standby Swap’ within the approved SAARC Swap Framework would provide necessary flexibility to the Framework and would enable India to provide a prompt response to the current request from SAARC member countries for availing the swap amount exceeding the present limit prescribed under the SAARC Swap Framework.
Cabinet approved the Framework on Currency Swap Arrangement for SAARC Member Countries on March 1, 2012 with the intention to provide a line of funding for short term foreign exchange requirements or to meet balance of payments crises till longer term arrangements are made or the issue is resolved in the short-term itself.
Under the Facility, RBI offers swaps of varying sizes in USD, Euro or INR to each SAARC member country depending on their two months import requirement and not exceeding US$ 2 billion in total.
The swap amount for each country has been defined in the above Facility, subject to a floor of USD 100 Million and a maximum of USD 400 Million.
Each Drawal will be for three months tenor and upto maximum of two rollovers.
RBI will negotiate the operational details bilaterally with the Central Banks of the SAARC countries availing the Standby Swap.

These include Declaring Large Hydropower Projects (HPO) as part of non-solar Renewable Purchase Obligation (RPO)
Large Hydropower Projects to be declared as Renewable Energy source (as per existing practice, only hydropower projects less than 25MW are categorized as Renewable Energy).
HPO as a separate entity within non-solar Renewable Purchase Obligation to cover LHPs commissioned after notification of these measures (SHPs are already covered under Non-Solar Renewable Purchase Obligation).
The trajectory of annual HPO targets will be notified by Ministry of Power based on the projected capacity addition plans in hydropower sector.
Necessary amendments will be introduced in the Tariff Policy and Tariff Regulations to operationalize HPO.
Tariff rationalization measures including providing flexibility to the developers to determine tariff by back loading of tariff after increasing project life to 40 years, increasing debt repayment period to 18 years and introducing escalating tariff of 2%;
Budgetary support for funding flood moderation component of hydropower projects on case to case basis; and
Major Impact including employment generation potential:
As most of the hydro power potential is located in the higher reaches of Himalayas and North- East Region, it will result in overall socio-economic development of the region by providing direct employment in the power sector.
It will also provide indirect employment/ entrepreneurial opportunities in the field of transportation, tourism and other small scale businesses.
Another benefit would be of having a stable grid considering 160 GW capacity addition by 2022 from infirm sources of power like solar and wind.
India is endowed with large hydropower potential of 1,45,320 MW of which only about 45,400 MW has been utilized so far.
Only about 10,000 MW of hydropower has been added in the last 10 years.
The hydropower sector is currently going through a challenging phase and the share of hydropower in the total capacity has declined from 50.36% in the 1960s to around 13% in 2018-19.
The importance of hydropower is increasing even more as the country has targeted to add 160 GW of intermittent Solar and Wind power by 2022 and 40% of the total capacity from non-fossil fuel sources by 2030 to honour its Nationally Determined Contribution for Climate Change.
However, DISOMS are reluctant sign Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs) Hydro Power due to higher tariff, particularly, in the initial years.
One of the reasons for high tariff of hydropower is the loading of cost of flood moderation and enabling infrastructure in the project cost.
Government of India has initiated numerous steps to combat the scourge of Corruption and Black Money in the last two and a half years.
The Union cabinet had approved a slew of initiatives in February 2016 to encourage digital payments and a transition to less-cash economy in a strategic manner.
The Prime Minister had highlighted these measures in his Man Ki Baat address in May 2016.
He had urged people to adopt cashless transactions.
He said “If we learn and adapt ourselves to use cashless transactions, then we will not require notes.
Under-hand dealings will stop; the influence of black money will be reduced.
Slowly we cultivated a habit and now we can’t do without those.
But the sooner this happens, the better it will be”.
It would be recalled that towards this end, the Government had launched a major drive for financial inclusion in terms of opening Jan Dhan accounts, giving a statutory basis for Aadhar, implementation of Directs Benefits Transfer, introduction of RuPay Cards and Voluntary Disclosure Scheme for unaccounted money.
Demonetization of 500 and 1000 Rs. notes was another important milestone in this endeavour.
Yet, as on date, nearly 95 per cent of India’s personal consumption expenditure transactions are cash-based giving rise to a very large informal economy limiting the ability of State to levy and raise taxes.
The Government of India had recently (December 8th) announced a slew of measures to promote digital payments (https://twitter.com/PMOIndia/status/807069075616608256/).
To increase overall transparency in the economy and to remove the pernicious influence of cash on the political and economic system, it is essential that we take a longer term view and bring in measures that would influence the behaviour of the consumers as well as merchants to shift to digital payment instruments.
It is now possible by leveraging technology to carry out business transactions digitally through mechanisms like UPI, USSD, Ru Pay cards and Aadhar Enabled Payment System (AEPS).
In a country like India where 65% of the population is below 35 years of age, whose IT prowess is well recognized and where even poor and illiterate people exercise their franchise through EVMs, this transformation toward digital economy is definitely possible, provided the citizens resolve to do so.
NITI Aayog announces the launch of the schemes Lucky Grahak Yojana and the Digi-धन Vyapar Yojana to give cash awards to consumers and merchants who utilize digital payment instruments for personal consumption expenditures.
The scheme specially focuses on bringing the poor, lower middle class and small businesses into the digital payment fold.
It has been decided that National Payment Corporation of India (NPCI) shall be the implementing agency for this scheme.
It would be useful to reiterate that NPCI is a not for profit company which is charged with a responsibility of guiding India towards being a cashless society.
The primary aim of these schemes is to incentivize digital transactions so that electronic payments are adopted by all sections of the society, especially the poor and the middle class.
It has been designed keeping in mind all sections of the society and their usage patterns.
For instance, the poorest of poor will be eligible for rewards by using USSD.
People in village and rural areas can participate in this scheme through AEPS.
It will comprise of two major components, one for the Consumers and the other for the Merchants:
a) Lucky Grahak Yojana [Consumers]:
i. Daily reward of Rs 1000 to be given to 15,000 lucky Consumers for a period of 100 days; ii.
b) Digi-धन Vyapar Yojana[Merchants]:
i. Prizes for Merchants for all digital transactions conducted at Merchant establishments ii.
To ensure that the focus of the scheme is on small transactions (entered into by common people), incentives shall be restricted to transactions within the range of Rs 50 and Rs 3000.
All transactions between consumers and merchants; consumers and government agencies and all AEPS transactions will be considered for the incentive scheme.
NPCI has been directed to ensure a technical and security audit of the same to ensure that the technical integrity of the process is maintained.
The estimated expenditure on the first phase of the scheme (up to 14th April 2017) is likely to be 340 Crores .
The Government will simultaneously carry out a review for further implementation.
India is transitioning at a rapid rate from a cash-user society to a cashless society.
This is a historic moment in our nation’s history when our nation is shedding old habits and rapidly adopting new means which shall propel us into a truly modern age.
PPT on ‘INCENTIVIZING DIGITAL PAYMENTS’
The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi has congratulated Justice Dalveer Bhandari on being re-elected to the International Court of Justice.
Our deep gratitude to all the members of UNGA as well as UNSC for their support and trust in India”, the Prime Minister said.
Thank you, every one!
Let’s give a big hand to our outstanding young exhibitors today.
Thank you for coming out in strength on a Sunday.
Reid Hoffman, your LinkedIn is a great product.
And, you are an inspiration to many here and in India.
Thank you, Mohan, Venkie, Ambassador.
It is a great pleasure to be here.
For me, this is a special event, because the idea of startups is close to my heart.
You are likely to wonder why, because governments and National capitals are supposed to stop or slow things down, not start them up.
I know this was once the view of Washington from Silicon Valley; and, this is exactly how tech specialists in Bengaluru thought about New Delhi.
And, I know that many of you think that the only problems that have not been solved are the ones for which you have not written the apps yet.
When I shifted to Delhi last year, I thought of my government as a Startup.
So, I also saw some of the bumps you face on the road.
I understand your challenges, but also the wonderful feeling of creating something new.
The course of human history and progress has been shaped by imagination, inspiration, invention and innovation.
I often say, if there’s a strong wind blowing, some might want to shut the window.
Others will want to put up a windmill or launch their sails on the seas.
The difference between perception of something as a challenge or an opportunity is the difference between inertia and initiative; status quo and progress.
The idea of Start Ups is as ancient as this world.
Each economic age has been defined by disruption of the previous one, by the evolution of ideas and products that displace the old ones.
Start Ups have always been the engine of progress.
The mega corporations of today were Startsup of yesterday.
What is different now is that the digital age has created a fertile new environment for Startups.
This is a world in which you don’t grow by extracting resources, but by spreading an idea.
More than the creator, it is the consumer, who discovers applications.
Today, the Startups defy the natural rates of growth.
An idea can become a global name within a year.
Customers can multiply at the rate of millions, employees at the rate of thousands and valuation at the rate of billions.
The convergence of technology, integration across diverse fields, distributed architecture and people willing to back an idea, have opened a new world for enterprise.
This ecosystem was born in the Silicon Valley.
No community is shaping our world as much as the one on this Californian Coast.
It isn’t just big names, but small firms that are fashioning every day new ways to enrich human life with the joy of artists and creators.
That underlines America’s success and inspires the world.
So, I see Startups, technology and innovation as exciting and effective instruments for India’s transformation, and for creating jobs for our youth.
We are a nation of 800 million youth below the age of 35 years.
They are eager for change; have the energy and drive to pursue it; and, the confidence to achieve it.
When each of the five hundred odd towns produces ten Startups and each of our six hundred thousand villages produce six small businesses, on a regular basis, we will create an enormous economic momentum and generate a huge number of jobs in our country.
India’s own ecosystem of startups is evolving rapidly.
It is driven by the energy, enterprise and innovation of our youth.
We have a huge market with rapid growth and untapped opportunities in every sector.
We now have the institutions, incentives and interest for new ventures.
We have incubators, accelerators and investors willing to back an idea and assume risks.
India has woken up to the potential of Startup Ventures with great enthusiasm and energy.
In the past few years, they have grown exponentially.
We have here an outstanding group of Startups from India.
They are applying technology to transform healthcare, education, agriculture, clean energy, security, financial inclusion of the poor and access to clean water.
Our Startups represent not just commercial success stories, but are powerful examples of social innovation.
The pace at which people in India are taking to digital technology defies our stereotypes of age, education, language and income.
There are nearly a billion people with cell phones in India; smart phones and internet users are in hundred millions, growing at high double digits.
We cannot simply continue on the traditional paths to development.
This is the vision and the spirit behind Digital India, which I spoke about last night: to use technology to transform governance, empower our citizens, eliminate barriers to opportunities, deepen social change, impart scale and speed to development, improve delivery of services, design affordable products for the poor, customize services for specific groups,and build a more sustainable future for our planet.
Startups will have an important role in achieving our vision.
From creating infrastructure to providing services, from manufacture of products to human resource development, from supporting governments to enabling citizens and promoting digital literacy, Digital India is a vast cyber world of opportunities for you.
I see Startups, not as short term investments, but as long term commitments.
Our application and enterprise is limited only by our imagination.
We have here today our Department of Space that provides free data on its portal.
In the course of past few months, we have put together 170 applications of space technology in governance and development.
Many of these could become the vehicles of new ventures in India.
But, it is not just about the opportunities generated on the digital platform and advanced science by urban enterprises.
I want to see the idea and the spirit of Startups light up the economies and the fortunes of people in rural India.
From handicrafts to tourism, the frontiers of possibilities and the scale of reach in India is immense.
I want this especially for our rural women, who have shown marvelous success in enterprise, whenever they have had opportunity.
They transform not only our rural economy, but also our society.
Our development models speak of Public Sector and Private Sector.
I speak of a third sector, Personal Sector, of individual enterprises, micro enterprises and micro finances.
That is why I focused on Startup India in the Independence Day Address this year.
We are launching schemes that will support our mission.
And, I assure you that they won’t trap your creativity in long government procedures.
One is the Atal Innovation Mission, after former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayeeji to promote innovation.
Another is SETU, which means bridge in Hindi – Self Employment & Talent Utilisation (SETU).
This will be an incubation and facilitation programme.
We are also setting up Electronics Development Fund to support design, development and launch of new products.
We are reforming our regulations and processes, and making it easier to start and do business in India.
We are making our digital infrastructure and services accessible and affordable that will also bring broadband to six hundred thousand villages, and free Wi Fi to schools, universities and public places.
We are also giving the highest importance to data privacy and security, intellectual property rights and cyber security.
So, Make in India, Skill India and Design India will create a surge of opportunities.
So, friends, as we thought of Startups, it was natural to choose Silicon Valley for our first overseas event.
For, India and the United States have a natural partnership of innovation and technology that has shaped the knowledge economy.
I am told thatIndians account for 15% of startups here.
Hundreds of thousands of Indian professionals here and in India are contributing to the global success of U.S. enterprises.
Many are leading them today.
Our universities, labs and firms are working together for next generation advanced bio fuels, solar energy and energy efficiency.
Young Stanford scholars are teaming up with Indian counterparts in Delhi to make affordable biomedical devices for rural India.
MIT Tata Centre’s Khethworks is changing the lives of small farmers with solar-based irrigation systems.
We have here with us Manu Prakash, a young Indian scientist in Stanford, who has a lab to his name at the university.
This is the power of our cooperation and collaboration.
Sitting here, you can touch the life of a young child in a remote village.
I also hope that a young girl in a small town in India will look at the exhibitors today and dream of her own project.
And, someone in Mumbai or the Bay Area will be the angel to her dreams.
This is the possibility of the digital bridge – to connect distant lives and change fortunes and future.
This is the potential of youth and innovation.
It can ignite a partnership between India and the United States, which can advance prosperity in our two countries and give new content to our strategic partnership.
It can enable us to lead in the digital century and find solutions to enduring human problems and emerging global challenges.
I am delighted to see so many new partnerships formed today.
I am honoured to launch the BHARAT Fund today – which stands not just for India, but also for Better Health, Agriculture, Renewable and Technologies.
I am delighted that Qualcomm announced a fund of USD 150 million for Startups in India.
I want to than TiE for its valued suggestions for creating a more supportive environment for Startups.

It is an honour to speak at the inaugural session of the 6th Ministerial Conference of the Heart of Asia- Istanbul Process on Afghanistan.
I thank Excellency Ghani for accepting my invitation and for gracing this conference.
It is also a great privilege for me to welcome all of you in Amritsar, a city blessed with simplicity, beauty and spirituality, and abode to the Golden Temple, the holiest shrines of Sikhs.
It is a place made sacred by Sikh Gurus who meditated here.
It embodies peace and humanism, and is open to all people and religions.
Its streets and parks tell stories of great valour and immense sacrifice.
The flow of trade, people and ideas through our region has often intersected in Amritsar on one of Asia’s oldest and longest surface arteries, the Grand Trunk Road.
Amritsar reinforces the value of restoring connectivity which is so crucial for the overall growth, stability and economic prosperity of Afghanistan.
Excellencies, Ladies and Gentlemen,
Since the turn of this century, the international community has extensively engaged in Afghanistan.
Major powers, regional countries and concerned nations from around the world have cooperated through multiple programmes of political, social, military, economic, and developmental support.
Our gathering today re-affirms the commitment of the international community to durable peace and lasting political stability in Afghanistan.
Our words and actions remain focused at advancing a critical unfinished mission of our time.
Indeed, this is also the intent of this conference, aptly captured in its theme, “Addressing challenges; Achieving prosperity”.
We have no doubt about the scale of the challenge.
But, we are equally determined to succeed.
The results of our collective efforts thus far have been hard-won, but mixed.
There have been important successes.
Much more remains to be done.
The need of the hour is to stand our ground and continue with our line of effort.
We must protect and build on the gains of the last fifteen years and march ahead.
The answers are all there.
The question is of resolve and action.
And, of putting Afghanistan and its people first.
For this, First, an Afghan-led, Afghan-owned and Afghan-controlled process is key.
It is the only guarantor of durability of solutions.
Second, we must demonstrate strong collective will to defeat terror networks that cause bloodshed and spread fear.
Terrorism and externally induced instability pose the gravest threat to Afghanistan’s peace, stability and prosperity.
And, the growing arc of terrorist violence endangers our entire region.
As such, support for voices of peace in Afghanistan alone is not enough.
It must be backed by resolute action.
Not just against forces of terrorism, but also against those who support, shelter, train and finance them.
Silence and inaction against terrorism in Afghanistan and our region will only embolden terrorists and their masters.
Third, our bilateral and regional commitments of material assistance for Afghanistan’s development and humanitarian needs must continue and increase.
Our cooperative endeavours in Afghanistan should contribute to its infrastructure and institutional capacity, and self-propelling engines of growth.
Fourth,we should all work to build stronger positive connectivity between Afghanistan and other countries of the region.
Afghanistan should be at the centre of our connectivity networks, not peripheral to them.
On our part, we see Afghanistan as the hub for strengthening links of connectivity between South Asia and Central Asia.
We cannot deny that the more connected Afghanistan is with the regional arteries of trade, capital and markets, the more assured would be its economic growth and progress.
President Ghani and I have converged on the priority of strengthening trade and transport linkages with other partners in the region.
On India’s part, our commitment to our brave Afghan brothers and sisters is absolute and unwavering.
The welfare of Afghanistan and its people is close to our hearts and minds.
The successful record of our partnership in projects, big and small, in Afghanistan speaks for itself.
And, the reach and benefit of such efforts extends to all corners of Afghanistan.
The Parliament Building in Kabul represents our strong commitment to Afghanistan’s democratic future.
Zeranj-Deleram highway and India-Afghanistan-Iran cooperation on Chahbahar would enable Afghanistan to link its economy with centres of strong economic growth in South Asia and beyond.
We also plan to connect Afghanistan with India through an air transport corridor
President Ghani and I have discussed additional measures for deepening our bilateral cooperation.
We are making progress in developing plans for utilization of the additional 1 billion US Dollar earmarked by India for capacity and capability building in Afghanistan.
It will extend to areas like water management, health, infrastructure, energy and skill development.
As India implements its additional commitments, we are open to work with other like-minded partners for the development of Afghanistan.
We are also happy to note the international commitments at the Brussels Conference in October and NATO’s Warsaw Summit in July this year.
We will continue efforts to scale up our ambition and dedication to assist Afghanistan.
I hope that your deliberations will produce constructive and forward looking pathways for action that:
Let us re-dedicate ourselves to making Afghanistan a Geography of Peace.

Further releases for the 1st installment to the remaining beneficiaries are being made.
The 2nd instalment under the scheme would be admissible after the1st of April, 2019.
In this connection, it is stated that the Union Cabinet, while approving the scheme on 1.2.2019, made Aadhaar seeding of the beneficiaries’ data compulsory for release of 2nd installment onwards.

However, Aadhaar number shall be compulsory for release of 2nd installment.
The Government will take adequate measures to validate the data before payment is made.

I am really happy to be here in the Hannover fair.
It is an added pleasure to talk to you that too in the presence of Chancellor Merkel.
Myself and Chancellor Merkel had a very good interaction over dinner last night.
You also must have met a number of Indian companies and CEOs.
I believe that the participation in Hannover fair would be very useful for both sides.
I request you to visit the India pavillion and the stalls of our State Government and private companies.
You will be able to see for yourself the winds of change in India.
We are very keen to develop the sectors where you are strong.
We need your involvement.
The scope and potential, the breadth and length of infrastructure and related developments is very huge in India.
Just to give you some examples:
• We have planned to build 50 million houses by 2022.
In addition, we are going to develop smart cities and mega industrial corridors.
• We are modernizing our Railway systems including signals, and railway stations.
We are planning metro rail in fifty cities and high speed trains in various corridors.
• Similar is the case with Highways.
• We are putting up new ports and modernizing the old ones through an ambitious plan called Sagarmala;
• Similar focus is on upgrading the existing Airports and putting up regional airports to enhance connectivity to places of economic and tourist importance.
• In financial services too, we are moving towards a more inclusive and faster delivery of financial products including bank loans and insurance.
• For this purpose, we opened 140 million bank accounts; increased FDI in insurance upto 49% and have set up MUDRA Bank.
• We also announced innovative schemes for insurance and pension to enhance social security for our citizens.
We also want to promote manufacturing in a big way particularly to create jobs for our youth.
For this purpose, we have launched a campaign called “Make in India”.
All this is a historic opportunity for the German companies.
You would already be knowing the direction of my Government and the steps we are taking.
We have committed ourselves for creating and improving the business environment.
I can assure you that once you decide to be in India, we are confident to make you comfortable.
Germany ranks 8th among foreign investor countries in India.
About 600 Indo-German Joint ventures are presently operating in India.
The purpose of my being here and participating in the Hannover Fair is to highlight that there is more potential in Indo-German economic collaboration.
Though we have a vibrant relationship, our economic partnership is not as much as both countries would like to have.
The flow of investments from Germany is well below the potential and less than Indian investments in Germany.
Many more German companies have the possibility of investing in India to take advantage of India’s potentials.
The potential lies in Manufacturing as well as infrastructure and in skill development for that purpose.
I know that the reason for this situation may not be from German side.
It is from the Indian side also.
I am here to assure the German companies that India is now a changed country.
Lot of efforts have been made and are still underway to improve the ‘Ease of Doing Business’ in the country.
• Reducing the complicated procedures, making them available at one platform, preferably online, simplifying the forms and formats has been taken up on war footing.
We do believe that FDI is important and it will not come in the country without a globally competitive business environment.
• We have removed lot of regressive taxation regimes.
We have taken bold steps of not dragging the litigation in a few cases where we felt that the steps of the previous government were not on right lines.
• In this budget, we allowed Tax pass through for AIFs, rationalization of capital gains of REITs, modification in PE norms and deferring the implementation of GAAR for two years.
We are constantly working to improve the business environment further.
• We are trying to introduce an element of transparency and predictability in taxation system.
• We have fast tracked approvals in industry and infrastructure.
This includes environmental clearances, extending the industrial licences, delicencing of defence items, and simplification of cross-border trade.
• Within a very short time, we introduced GST Bill in Parliament.
Such measures have helped in building up an enhanced investor confidence.
The sentiments for private investment and inflow of foreign investments are positive.
FDI inflows have gone up by 36% during April-2014 and January-2015 against the same period in previous year;
Our growth rate is about 7%-plus.
Most of the international financial institutions including the World Bank, IMF, UNCTAD, OECD and others are predicting even faster growth and even better in the coming years.
MOODY’s have recently upgraded the rating of India as “positive” on account of our concrete steps in various economic segments.
It is the effort of my Government to encourage innovation, R&D and entrepreneurship in the country.
In this year’s budget, we have set up some innovative institutional mechanisms for that purpose.
Similarly, for infrastructure development, we have taken some far reaching steps.
• First of all we have made an all-time high allocation for Roads and railways sectors.
• In addition, we are setting up India Infrastructure Investment Fund.
• We have also allowed Tax free Bonds in the Infrastructure sector including roads and railways.
I wish all success to the Hannover Messe.
I also wish all participants good luck and progress.
I also take this opportunity for inviting more and more German companies to India.

In the process of nation building, we often arrive at a moment which leads us to a path breaking juncture and opens up a plethora of opportunities imploring us to aspire for new dreams.
At the stroke of the midnight hour today, together we shall ensure a pioneering future of the nation.
Within a few moments from now, our nation will embark upon a new economic regime.
The entire 1.25 billion citizens of the country are a witness to this historical event.
I do not believe that this process of GST is restricted to the scope of economy only.
Let us reminisce the 9th of December, 1946 when this same Central Hall witnessed the first meeting to discuss the country’s Constitution.
Today we share the same place of pride.
The front seats of this hall were ordained by the iconic national heroes like Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru, Maulana Abul Kalam Azad, Sardar Vallabh Bhai Patel, Baba Saheb Bhimrao Ambedkar, Acharya Kripalani, Dr. Rajendra Prasad, Sarojini Naidu.
The same House which once on 14 August, 1947, at the stroke of the midnight hour, witnessed the most pious moment of the nation attaining freedom!
When the Constitution was framed, it introduced a framework of equal opportunity and rights for all.
Very importantly, GST also intends to bring in economic reforms.
It is a great example of Co-operative Federalism which shall facilitate inclusive growth of the nation.
With the launch of GST, Team India has proven its potential and diligence.
This GST Council has developed such systems wherein the underprivileged gets all the promised facilities.
Today, GST Council had its 18th meeting and GST would be implemented in a short while from now.

Chanakya’s words summarize the whole GST process.
Even if something is very difficult to be achieved, one can obtain it with penance and hard work.
Can we imagine, when we became independent there were more than 500 Princely states.
Just as Sardar Vallabh Bhai Patel unified India by helping several princely states subsume into a common entity, the GST will bring economic unification.
If we take into consideration the 29 states, the 7 Union Territories, the 7 taxes of the Centre and the 8 taxes of the states, and several different taxes for different commodities, the number of taxes sum up to a figure of 500!
I was wondering if he was present here then how he would have reacted looking at the plethora of taxes.
The same product will have different prices in, say Delhi , Gurugram and Noida which are 25-30 kilometres apart.
This is because Haryana , Delhi and Uttar Pradesh have different tax regimes.
As a result of these variations, a citizen wonders that – if I go to Gurugram I get the product at one price, if I go to Delhi I get the same product for a different price and if I go to Noida I get it for yet another price.
There was confusion in everybody’s mind.
Arun Ji has vividly explained that once GST is in place, all sorts of taxes like sales tax, VAT etc. will cease to exist.
Long wait by vehicles at toll plazas will end.
Fuels worth crores of rupees are wasted.
And that causes damage to the environment as well.
Now we will be free from of all those troubles as the entire country will have a similar tax structure.
Sometimes certain items, especially the perishable ones that were supposed to reach their destination in time, were delayed because of the time taken for processing; and it resulted in losses at both ends.
Today we are getting rid of all that.
GST has an inherent strength of eliminating the possibility of ordinary businessmen being harassed by the officers.
Traders with a turnover up to Rs. 20 lakh are totally exempt from this.
Traders with a turnover up to Rs. 75 lakh are also having many exemptions.
Friends, GST is not limited to the technicalities of the term.
In fact, the system is for the welfare of the poor.
But somewhere the limited resources became a hurdle in the fulfillment of the needs of our country’s poor.
Even today we hear about such issues.
It is true that everyone is not tech-savvy.
However, if any household has a class 10th-12th student, he would definitely know about technology.

It also boosts the exports of the country.
All the states of India will get equal opportunity for development.
GST is like our Railways.
Under GST, for the first time, the central and the state governments will work together towards the same direction.
In 2022, India will celebrate the Diamond Jubilee year of achieving Freedom.
We have embarked upon a journey to create a New India.
The New India which is the dream of our 1.25 billions Indians!
Therefore Ladies and Gentlemen, GST shall play a key role in helping us build the India of our dreams.
The last verse of Lokmanya Tilak’s “Gita Rahsaya” ideally encapsulates the essence of the way the GST team has strived to achieve it.
The verse from the Rigveda continues to inspire us till today.
It means that we all must have similar resolution, decision and emotion, our hearts should be on the same plane, so that everyone supports and collaborates towards same accomplishments.

A revolutionary taxation system for the digital India.
GST is the taxation system of New India; of the Digital India.

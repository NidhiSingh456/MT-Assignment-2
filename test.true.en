indeed , India is home to ancient , rich and diverse cultures , through which runs an under-lying theme of unity .
the concept of “ Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam – the world is one family ” , is deeply imbibed in Indian philosophy .
it reflects our inclusive traditions .
in the twenty-first century , technology is becoming an enabler or this concept .
it helps us create a seam-less , integrated world .
we not only have a growing number of innovative entrepreneurs , but also a growing market for tech innovation .
India is best placed to leverage the power of technology and leap-frog into the future while ensuring empowerment of every citizen .
this has been possible through a change in public behavior and processes .
digital India has not remained merely a Government initiative , but has become a way of life .
technology has transcended power-point presentations and has become an inseparable part of people ’ s lives .
while most Government initiatives depend on a Government push , Digital India is succeeding because of the people ’ s pull .
the JAM trinity of combining 320 million Jan Dhan bank accounts of poor with Aadhaar and Mobile with direct benefits of welfare measures has saved Rupees 57 thousand Crores .
around 22 million digital hospital transactions across 172 hospitals in India are bringing comfort in the lives of patients .

this simple IT framework has improved transparency in Government procurement .

yesterday , at Mumbai University , I had the opportunity to dedicate to the nation , the Wadhwani Institute for Artificial Intelligence .
this is an independent , non-profit research institute , with a mission of Artificial Intelligence for Social Good .
a few days ago , in Dubai , at the World Government Summit , I had the opportunity to visit an exhibition on the “ Museum of the Future . ”
this has been planned as an incubator for ideas , and a driver for innovation .
I appreciate the pioneers of technology , some of whom are in the audience today , for the work they are doing .
they are helping to secure a better , more comfortable future for humanity .
we stand today , at the cusp of the fourth Industrial Revolution .
technology , if used well for public good , can deliver lasting prosperity to mankind and a sustainable future for our planet .
it is in this context , that I place the World Conference on Information Technology , in India today .
the key themes at this Conference , reflect the opportunities that await us .
disruptive technologies such as Block-chain and the Internet of Things , will have a deep impact in the way we live and work .
they will require rapid adaptation in our workplaces .
skilling citizens for the workplace of the future is important .
in India , we have launched the National Skill Development Mission to prepare our children and youth for a bright future .
we also need to ensure that our existing work-forces able to re-skill , as new technologies emerge .
one of the invited Speakers at this event , the robot Sophia shows the potential of new technologies .
NASSCOM has also identified fifty-five job roles that are going to be in high demand globally .
I am sure , the “ skills of future ” platform will greatly help India maintain its competitive edge .
digital technology is now at the heart of every business .
new technologies must be embedded in various operations and processes of a business entity .
how can we prepare our millions of small and medium businesses for this transformation , in a short time ?
keeping in mind the importance of innovation , in the future of economy and business , the Government of India has launched the Start-up India initiative .
we believe our startups are the key to finding viable and economical solutions across sectors and verticals .
under the Atal Innovation Mission , we are building Atal Tinkering Labs in schools across India .
the objective of this scheme is to foster curiosity , creativity and imagination in young minds .
I am sure , that as you deliberate on various themes of Information Technology , you shall keep the interests of the common man at the back of your mind .
I once again welcome the distinguished delegates from across the world , to India .
may your deliberations be productive ?
may the outcomes benefit the poor and the under-privileged across the world ?
last year , we had to endure so many trials – the scorching heat of the summer , scarcity of water , drought conditions and so on .
this news in itself charges us with a lot of enthusiasm .
I extend my greetings to all our farmer brethren hoping for a bountiful rainfall .
in our country , like the toiling farmers , our scientists are also achieving success on many fronts to take our country to new heights .
I have believed it right from the beginning that the new generation should nurture the dream of becoming scientists , should have keen interest in Science , and our youngsters should step forward with the zeal to do something for the coming generations .
I also want to share another bright news with you .
for the past many years , several students have made their contributions to this project .
in a way , this academic satellite is a living example of the soaring flight of courage and ambition of the young India .
that has led these our students to make this satellite .
on similar lines as achieved by these Pune students , the students of Satyabhama University of Chennai in Tamil Nadu also created their satellite ; and their SathyabamaSAT has also been launched .
we have been hearing these things since childhood , and every child wishes deep inside his heart to touch the sky and grab a few stars .
keeping this in mind , in my opinion , these two satellites made by the students and launched by ISRO , are extremely important and most valuable .
all these students deserve hearty congratulations .
along with America , the satellites of many other countries were launched on Indian soil by Indian scientists and along with these , those two satellites made by our students also reached outer space .
still , some incidents infuse a new life into this slogan .
this time in the results of 10th and 12th classes , our daughters have been doing wonderfully well , which is a matter of pride .
you get Goose pimples just at the mention of ‘ women fighter pilots ’ ; we feel so proud that these three flying Officer daughters of ours- Avni Chaturvedi , Bhawna Kanth and Mohana , have achieved this great feat .
what these three daughters have accomplished is truly special .
flying Officer Avni is from Rewa in Madhya Pradesh , flying Officer Bhawana is from Begusarai in Bihar and flying Officer Mohana is from Vadodara in Gujarat .
you must have noticed that all these three daughters do not hail from metro cities of India .
they do not even come from the capital cities of their respective states .
despite hailing from small cities and towns , they nurtured dreams as high as the sky , and they also made them come true .
I extend my heartiest wishes to these three daughters Avni , Bhawana and Mohana as well as their parents .
my dear Countrymen , a few days ago on 21st June , the whole world organised grand shows in observance of the anniversary of the International Day for Yoga .
as an Indian , when we witness the entire world coming together through Yoga , we realize that the entire world is getting linked with our past , present and future .
we are forging a unique bond with the rest of the world .
in India too , the International Yoga Day was celebrated at over 1 lakh places , with a lot of fervour and enthusiasm in myriad forms and hues , and in an atmosphere of gaiety .
I also got an opportunity to perform Yoga in Chandigarh amidst thousands of Yoga lovers .
it was worth watching the zeal of the young and old alike .
you must have seen that last week the Indian government issued a postage stamp on ‘ Surya Namaskar ’ on the occasion of International Yoga Day .
this time , people all over the world , on Yoga Day , were witness to two special events .
tell me , which Indian would not feel proud at such happenings ?
Yoga has the power to connect the entire world .
but for that to happen , first all of us need to get connected to Yoga .
Swati Srivastava from Satna in Madhya Pradesh , called me up on telephone after the Yoga Day and left a message for all of you but it seems that it pertains more to me : –
sound Byte : “ I wish that my entire country should be healthy and all the poor people also should remain free from diseases .
and I have seen that there are some countries in the world which have T.V. channels exclusively dedicated to Yoga 24 hours a day .
and you probably know that , during the month of June , in view of the International Yoga Day , I used to share a video everyday of one particular asana of Yoga through Twitter and face Book .
if you go to the website of the Ministry of Ayush , you will see available there a 40-45 minutes very good video demonstrating one after another , different kinds of yog asanas for different parts of the body that you can do , people of all ages can do .
to you and through you to all the people interested in Yoga , I would like to exhort to get connected to it .
all the prevalent systems of Yoga , all the functioning Yoga institutions , all the different Yoga Gurus , I have urged all of them to run a successful campaign this entire year on how to defeat Diabetes through Yoga .
can we control Diabetes through Yoga ?
some people have been successful in that .
a lot of people have worked in this direction .
some diabetic patients have also been able to control it thorough their yogic practice .
all the rights of the citizens were suspended .
the country was turned into a prison .
lakhs of people along with Jai Prakash Narain , thousands of leaders , many organisations were put behind bars .
many books have been written on that dark period .
there might have been locks on newspaper houses , radio might have been speaking just one kind of language , still on the other hand , given the opportune moment , the citizens give an example of the power of Democracy .
a great example of the democratic strength of the common people was witnessed during Emergency .
and we must keep reminding our country of its democratic strength from time to time .
and our endeavour should be to make people aware of their power and to always have the tendency to further strengthen it by linking more and more people to it .
the chasm between the governments and the people leads to ruin .
my endeavour has always been to ensure that the nation moves forward on the strength of people ’ s participation .
recently , when my government completed two years of functioning , some young people of modern thinking suggested , “ When you talk such big things about democracy , then why don ’ t you get your government rated by the people also . ”
in a way it had a tone of challenge as well as advice .
but that stirred my mind .
these days technology has changed so much that if people get together and form a group and if they decide to misuse technology , then who knows in which direction they might take forward this survey . ”
they thus expressed their concern .
but I felt , “ No , we should go ahead even if it is a risk .
we should give it a try and see what happens .
now a lot of surveys are conducted after the elections , during the elections , at other times also over some issues , sometimes to gauge the popularity , but the sample size of these surveys is not very big .
lakhs of you displayed your interest in this but 3 lakh people devoted their time and put in serious effort for giving an answer to each and every question .
I am grateful to these 3 lakh people that they displayed a lot of self initiative in rating the government .
thus , my primary impression is that there has been a large and active participation of people connected to rural India and poverty issues .
this I liked the most .
so you have seen that while on 26th June some years ago the voice of the people was stifled , now is the time , when the people make their decisions , they judge whether the government is doing the right thing or not , is performing well or poorly .
this is the real power of democracy .
my dear countrymen , today I want to make a special appeal for one thing .
there was a time when taxes were so pervasive , that it became a habit to avoid taxation .
one generation still feels that it is best to keep away from the government .
today I want to impress upon you that we end up losing our peace of mind by trying to escape from rules and regulations .
as a result , anybody can trouble and harass us .
why should we let this happen ?
I appeal to the countrymen to do this .
to the people who have undisclosed income , the Government of India has given a chance to declare such income .
the government has presented before the country a special facility to disclose undisclosed income by the 30th of September .
we can be free ourselves of various burdens just by paying a fine .
I have also promised that for those who voluntarily declare to the government their assets and their undisclosed income , then the government will not conduct any kind of enquiry .
at the same time , I want to tell the people of the country that please consider this plan , which is up to 30th September as your last chance .
in between , I had even told the Members of the Parliament that after 30th September if any citizen is put through any difficulty , the one who does not want to follow due rules of government , then it will not be possible to help them .
if they want to follow rules , we should encourage them , and lovingly help them cross over .
it is important to build an atmosphere of trust .
we shall have to bring about a change through our conduct .
we shall have to reassure the taxpayer .
I stressed this upon them and I noticed that they too realized that today when the nation is surging ahead , all of us must contribute to it .
and when I was taking inputs from them in this conclave , I gathered information which I want to share with you as well .
none of you will believe that in a country of 125 crore people , one and a half , only one and a half lakh people exist , whose taxable income is more than 50 lakh rupees .
nobody will be able to swallow something like this .
people having a taxable income of more than 50 lakh rupees can be seen in big cities in large numbers .
and in another way , this is the way out to save yourself from any trouble that could arise after 30th September .
my dear countrymen , the common man of this country is always looking for a chance to do something for the country .
when I asked the people to give up their cooking gas subsidy , more than 1 crore families of this country voluntarily gave up their subsidy .
and now I want to cite an example especially for those people who have undisclosed income .
yesterday when I went to Pune for the Smart City programme , over there I got the chance to meet Shri Chandrakant Damodar Kulkarni and his family .
do you know what the reason is ?
Shri Chandrakant Kulkarni is an ordinary man who belongs to an average middle class family .
we certainly do not have any right to evade tax in this country where there is one such government employee , who after retirement , out of a pension of mere sixteen thousand rupees , gives five thousand for the Cleanliness Campaign .
no one could be a greater source of inspiration than Chandrakant Kulkarni .
and for the people who are associated with the Cleanliness Campaign also , there could be no better inspiring example than Chandrakant Kulkarni .
a man with a pension of sixteen thousand rupees sends me cheques worth two lakhs , sixty thousand in advance , is this a small thing ?
my dear countrymen , Santosh Negi from Pauri Garhwal in Uttarakhand , has called up to relate one of his experiences .
he has given a message regarding water conservation .
friends , his experience can be of use to you as well : –
sound Byte : “ drawing inspiration from you , in our school , before the onset of monsoon we dug 250 small trenches which were 4 feet deep , along the side of the playground , so that rainwater could be collected in these .
this way the play ground remained unspoilt and there was no danger of children drowning in these … and we managed to save crores of litres of rainwater which fell on the playfield . ”
we should make every effort to conserve every single drop of water .
how can we retain the rainwater of the villages there itself and similarly preserve rainwater of cities therein .
to recharge Mother Earth once again , how can we replenish water back to the earth ?
we are so concerned about saving lives ; we should be equally concerned about saving water .
this 1922 is one such number that if you give a missed call to it , you can listen to Mann Ki Baat in the language of your choice .
by listening to Mann Ki Baat , at the time of your convenience , in the language of your choice , you too can make up your mind and resolve to contribute to the journey of the nation ’ s progress .
from regions in conflict to the streets of distant cities , terrorism extracts a deadly price .
old structures of terrorism remain .
there are countries that still use it as an instrument of state policy .
but , we also see the changing character of terrorism : global links , franchise relations , home-grown terrorism and use of cyber space for recruitment and propaganda .
there is a new level of threat to pluralist and open societies .
the territory of recruitment and the target of attacks is the same – society .
and , we tend to be selective in using the instruments that we have .
even more important than what we face is how we respond to the threat .
the world must speak in one voice and act in unison against terrorism , without any political considerations .
there should be no distinction between terrorist groups or discrimination between states .
we must isolate those who support and sponsor terrorism ; and , stand with those who share our values of humanism .
we need to restructure the international legal framework to deal with the unique challenges of terrorism .
we should also adopt a Comprehensive Convention on International Terrorism without any delay .
international cooperation in intelligence and counter-terrorism should increase .
we should strengthen efforts to prevent supply of arms to terrorists , disrupt terrorist movements , and curb and criminalise terror financing .
we have to help each other secure our cyber space , and minimize use of internet and social media for terrorist activities .
we need to involve religious leaders , thinkers and opinion makers for a social movement against extremism , particularly addressed to the youth .
this is needed most in countries where it is most prevalent .
we need to delink terror and religion and work together to counter radicalization .
it is equally important to promote broader peace and stability in West Asia and Africa .
this is also required for addressing the current refugee crisis .
today , there are an estimated 60 million people in need of protection worldwide .
the West Asian crisis has focused global attention on this acute humanitarian challenge .
it also has wide-ranging impact in receiving countries .
we thank the countries that have opened their borders and shelters .
we also need a long term approach and a stronger role for the United Nations in dealing with one of our greatest human challenges across the world .

and it is a measure of our shared ambition and commitment that six short months after that visit ; your extraordinary visit is taking place to India .

Prime Minister , I have a reputation of being impatient in getting results .
if I may let out an open secret , I know that so are you .

huge relief for senior citizens who have to produce Life Certificates each year to continue receiving pension .
the Prime Minister said that after the push towards self-certification , this digital life certificate was another enabling mechanism which would benefit the common man .
the proposed digital certification will do away with the requirement of a pensioner having to submit a physical Life Certificate in November each year , in order to ensure continuity of pension being credited into his account .
the Department of Electronics and IT has developed a software application which will enable the recording of the pensioner`s Aadhar number and biometric details from his mobile device or computer , by plugging in a biometric reading device .
this will conclusively establish that the pensioner was alive at the time of authentication .
the earlier requirement entailed that a pensioner either personally presents himself before the Pension disbursing Agency , or submits a Life Certificate issued by authorities specified by the Central Pension Accounting Office ( CPAO ) .
at present , 50 lakh individuals draw pension from the Central Government alone .
a similar number draw pension from State and Union Territory Governments .
several PSUs also provide pension benefits .
over 25 lakh retired personnel draw pension from the Armed Forces .
the Aadhar-Based Digital Life Certificate will go a long way in reducing hardship which so many senior citizens have to go through to produce a Life Certificate every year .
the software application system will be made available to pensioners and other stakeholders on a large scale at no extra cost .
it can be operated on a personal computer or a smartphone , along with an inexpensive biometric reading device .
this facility will also be made available at Common Service Centres being operated under the National e-Governance Plan , for the benefit of pensioners residing in remote and inaccessible areas .

he said Chhattisgarh had the potential to emerge as one of the most developed states in India .
he added that the investment of Rs. 24,000 crore that would flow into the region , as a result of the MoUs signed today in the Railways and steel sectors , will bring about a big change in the lives of people .

the Prime Minister said that after formation of his Government , several States had raised concerns with regard to the implementation of the Right to Fair Compensation and Transparency in Land Acquisition , Rehabilitation and Resettlement Act , 2013 .
he said many States had felt that development work was suffering due to the provisions of the 2013 Act ; and some Chief Ministers had requested for changes in the Act , and sent letters to this effect .

the Union Cabinet chaired by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi , has given its approval to a number of amendments in the FDI Policy .
these are intended to liberalise and simplify the FDI policy so as to provide ease of doing business in the country .
in turn , it will lead to larger FDI inflows contributing to growth of investment , income and employment .
foreign Direct Investment ( FDI ) is a major driver of economic growth and a source of non-debt finance for the economic development of the country .
Government has put in place an investor friendly policy on FDI , under which FDI up to 100 % , is permitted on the automatic route in most sectors / activities .
measures undertaken by the Government have resulted in increased FDI inflows in to the country .
during the year 2014-15 , total FDI inflows received were US $ 45.15 billion as against US $ 36.05 billion in 2013-14 .
during 2015-16 , country received total FDI of US $ 55.46 billion .
in the financial year 2016-17 , total FDI of US $ 60.08 billion has been received , which is an all-time high .
it has been felt that the country has potential to attract far more foreign investment which can be achieved by further liberalizing and simplifying the FDI regime .
accordingly , the Government has decided to introduce a number of amendments in the FDI Policy .
Government approval no longer required for FDI in Single Brand Retail Trading ( SBRT )
civil Aviation
however , this provision was presently not applicable to Air India , thereby implying that foreign airlines could not invest in Air India .
construction Development : townships , Housing , Built-up Infrastructure and Real Estate Broking Services
it has been decided to clarify that real-estate broking service does not amount to real estate business and is therefore , eligible for 100 % FDI under automatic route .
extant policy provides for 49 % FDI under automatic route in Power Exchanges registered under the Central Electricity Regulatory Commission ( Power Market ) Regulations , 2010 .
however , FII / FPI purchases were restricted to secondary market only .
it has now been decided to do away with this provision , thereby allowing FIIs / FPIs to invest in Power Exchanges through primary market as well .
other approval requirements under FDI Policy :
1 . as per the extant FDI policy , issue of equity shares against non-cash considerations like pre-incorporation expenses , import of machinery etc. is permitted under Government approval route .

it has now been decided that for investments in automatic route sectors , requiring approval only on the matter of investment being from country of concern , FDI applications would be processed by Department of Industrial Policy &amp; Promotion ( DIPP ) for Government approval .
cases under the government approval route , also requiring security clearance with respect to countries of concern , will continue to be processed by concerned Administrative Department / Ministry .
FDI policy on Pharmaceuticals sector inter-alia provides that definition of medical device as contained in the FDI Policy would be subject to amendment in the Drugs and cosmetics Act .

further , it has also been decided to amend the definition of ‘ medical devices ’ as contained in the FDI Policy .
Prohibition of restrictive conditions regarding audit firms :
the extant FDI policy does not have any provisions in respect of specification of auditors that can be appointed by the Indian investee companies receiving foreign investments .
it has been decided to provide in the FDI policy that wherever the foreign investor wishes to specify a particular Auditor / audit firm having international network for the Indian investee company , then audit of such investee companies should be carried out as joint audit wherein one of the auditors should not be part of the same network .

the amount will be disbursed directly to the District Collectors .
the Prime Minister spoke to the Minister for Petroleum and Natural Gas , Shri Dharmendra Pradhan , and sought information on the situation arising out of the floods .
this will benefit about 48.41 lakh Central Government employees and 61.17 lakh pensioners .
this will enable States to regulate trade of these essential commodities and to continue to take effective operations under the essential commodities Act , 1955 .
they can impose stock limits / licensing requirements etc. to curb unscrupulous trading , hoarding and profiteering .
the extension will also help the States in tackling the problem of ensuring adequate availability of these commodities in the domestic market and keep prices under control .
the Government has taken a series of policies , initiatives and measures to enhance availability and moderate prices of essential commodities , especially pulses and onions .
future trade in pulses like urad and tur has already been suspended .
export of pulses has been banned and there is zero duty on import of pulses .
pulses have also been included for assistance under the Price stabilization scheme .
to increase availability of pulses in the domestic market 5000 tons of urad and 5000 tons of tur has been ordered to be imported .
these imports are likely to reach shortly , which will ease the price situation .
the scheme is to be taken up under a new Central Sector Plan Scheme of Ministry of Power ( MoP ) .
the scheme is to be implemented with the assistance of World Bank loan and the budget of MoP .
after commissioning , the project will be owned and maintained by the State Governments .
presently , all the six NER States are connected to transmission network at 132 KV and below .
the 33 KV system is the backbone of power distribution system in the six NER States .
in order to reduce the gap between the requirement and availability of the intra-state transmission and distribution system , it is necessary to provide 132 KV / 220 KV connectivity to all the six NER States for proper voltage management and lower distribution losses .
similarly , the distribution system in all six NER States which mainly relies on 33 KV network would be strengthened substantially .
implementation of this project will create a reliable State power grid and improve its connectivity to the upcoming load centres , and thus extend the benefits of the grid connected power to all the consumers .
the project would also provide the required grid connectivity to such villages and towns of the States , where development of distribution system at the downstream level has been taking place under Gol sponsored RGGVY / APDRP / R-APDRP schemes .

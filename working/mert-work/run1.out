– and a glimpse of this lifestyle , and society in practice . 
but this all stakeholders concerned for the benefit of . 
for me , the World Bank ’ s the Report reflects the determination and hard work of change is possible . 
I say this because this situation in India has now come from where to improve easier . 
our efforts to it . 
management in the language of Firstly , we have easy UDAN for serious occasion .

sometimes we never complexities of later shows as we climate change , with ; never allow the result of our own decisions . 
for example , information technology development potential and to enhance productivity and was ; although , the various भटकाव simplicity we can having . 
as many times that we are in a meeting and their संदेशों in the commonman ’ s greed .

our University highly Regulation shackles of and बोझि on procedures , free from . 
there on more अकादमि of freedom and autonomy should be and educational of research should also be on .

सीपीएएफएफसी , Madam Lee शाओलिन , 
Honourable Chief Minister , and Mayor , 
India and China relations , it is a landmark moment . 
today , we ongoing cooperation between the two countries and to pursue through a new beginning . 
in the times to come , it is our economic partnership and our contacts between people to one of the most important instrument . 
the thirteen years the Chief Minister systems and a year , the Prime Minister on this platform to stay in position as a special place in my heart . 
but , this new institution so much giving importance of my thoughts are not only . 
our experiences of दृढ़ I believe that development of State in important role . 
the demographic , social and economic level immense diversity and vast and densely populated countries , particularly in terms of truth . 
when Constitutional and political systems federal structure , then the and more than relevant . 
the world ’ s more densely populated countries in both India and China these values . 
the Constitution of India , in the State Government ’ s economic and social development is a major role in . 
the Union Government for the overall economic environment . 
he for a comprehensive social and economic set the agenda and their . 
he developmental policies and schemes launched . 
he resource management . 
but , after all , their implementation in the State Governments to play a pivotal role . 
but , as I have seen his experience , State Governments States for the development of the many such initiatives . 
our under the Constitution the level of autonomy and accountability are the benefits of उठाती . 
common national environment , State different level performance . 
business for investors , they also Indian or foreign , they have come from New Delhi , but begin their success after all state capitals depends on . 
success is important needs में- infrastructure , land , सुवि धाएं , a skilled human resources and is approvals हैं-जो involved in the end , the State Governments have varying . 
but , for me , our national endeavour in the States of only his statutory and legal responsibility because of . 
it also basic management principle creates . 
when we all the spirit of partnership in the , when we all have to success share in then success , is going . 
that is why I talk of Team India . 
that is why I am confident that India ’ s development of the Union Government ’ s only pillar , but will not be that the Union Government and our all the States Governments as 30 pillar . 
the science of ordinary rules of that the foundation for stronger and more stable . 
the development of a framework to support . 
that is why I talk of cooperative federalism , where the Central and State partner . 
I cooperative and the Global Competitiveness Index of federalism also , including the State investment and nine he drew करियां for each other from the competition . 
this give shape to the vision for the last year , we have fast to . 
when we old Planning Commission to named NITI Aayog institution , we have changed from India for the first time in such institutions in the State Governments to formal , and a role . 
we have taken by the Union Government , State Governments more resources of the necessary बढ़ोतरी . 
and , when we auctions of coal more revenue कमाना , we launched the States , including with of coal खानें . 
I their respective Ministries to say that they conferences from Delhi on state capitals and other cities are , so that they too can receive the benefit of such events . 
we do State Governments in partnership with the spirit of their concerns and sensitivity to work with . 
and , we do so , we have to any State in on in position of political party , thematic no . 
so , when I State Governments to participate in this event with China , then I with States , connectivity , thought about , but their comprehensive political representation of . 
each to the nation to strengthen our international partnerships required . 
integrated in the world of connectivity are going . 
trade , investment , innovation , technology , tourism , education , skills and health , such as in the areas of international partnerships , together with the State Governments of interest has been going them and their success in accountability also . 
I have to within and outside coming , the State delegations be that the state level connectivity , often more focused and useful . 
the State Governments many decisions taken at the earliest . 
it on the State Governments and more sensitive and national activities and needs to be sensitive and alert . 
I therefore this platform and a great importance . 
India has a country with the first time platform . 
and , it is a fitting that the beginning with China . 
the world ’ s two major economies , are growing together with the fastest growing major economy in . 
our greater economic engagement . 
we also common challenges . 
we also have shared some experience . 
we both our countries to various parts of development in a separate speed . 
our economic ties with are going . 
last year , Mr. Xi ’ during the visit , we have our economic relations to new heights of an ambitious plan fixed . 
we agreed that China Maharashtra and Gujarat two Industrial Park लगायेगा . 
we are pleased that the two States , the Chief Minister are present here . 
our Railways sector in India in improving agreed cooperation . 
I have Chinese companies in India ’ s manufacturing sector , invited investment in India . 
President Xi has over the next five years ( billion ) 20 billion dollars of Chinese investments . 
some of the trade Agreement will be in Shanghai tomorrow . 
I believe that if provincial and State Governments close contact in our vision , that is easier . 
it will take our other interests and also will be – especially people-to-people contact at to carry forward the momentum of all relations , which is at the centre of . 
between India and China , Gujarat and गुआंगदोंग already relations in ( System टर-स State रिलेशनशिप , ) . 
our in many cities also such relationship ( System टर-सिटी रिलेशंस ) . 
during the visit , we नाटक-सिचुआन relations and four cities in the beginning of – टर-सिटी relations . 
this sense of also , beginning with President Xi ’ in India , Ahmedabad during the visit of was and I have also launched from a visit to Xian . 
these developments in the welcome . 
we are truly our relationship to our national capitals go out of the state capitals and take cities . 
therefore , the Prime Minister with the beginning of this platform to is a matter of .

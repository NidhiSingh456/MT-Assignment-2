the सीपीएएफएफसी Madam शाओलिन New Delhi , 
the Chief Minister Hon ’ ble Prime Minister , and Mayor , 
India and China relations , it is a landmark moment . 
today , we ongoing cooperation between the two countries and to pursue through a new beginning . 
in the coming years , our economic partnership and our contacts between people to one of the most important instrument . 
the thirteen years the Chief Minister systems and a year , the Prime Minister on this platform to stay in position as a special place in my heart . 
but , this new institution even more important than due to my thoughts are not only . 
our experiences of दृढ़ I believe that development of State in important role . 
the demographic , social and economic level highly such a and densely populated countries , particularly in terms of truth . 
when statutory and political systems , federal structure for this , even more relevant . 
the world ’ s more densely populated countries in both India and China these values . 
the Constitution of India , in the State Government ’ s economic and social development is a major role in . 
the Union Government for the overall economic environment . 
he for a comprehensive social and economic set the agenda and their . 
he launched developmental policies and programmes . 
he resources management . 
but , after all , their implementation in the State Governments to play a pivotal role . 
but , as I have seen his experience , State Governments States , for the development of many initiatives . 
our under the Constitution the level of autonomy and responsibility उठाती benefits of . 
equally , in an environment , State different level performance . 
business for investors , they also Indian or foreign , have come from New Delhi , but begin their success after state capitals depends on . 
success is important needs में- infrastructure , land , सुवि धाएं of skilled human resources , and is approvals हैं-जो involved in the end , the State Governments on . 
but , for me , our national endeavour in the States of only his statutory and legal responsibility because of . 
it also infrastructure management creates principle . 
when we all in the spirit of partnership , when we are all success in his part , of success , is going . 
that is why I talk of Team India . 
that is why I am confident that India ’ s growth of the Union Government ’ s only pillar , but will not be that the Union Government and our all State Governments of 30 pillar . 
this simple norms of science that this is the foundation for stronger and more stable . 
the development of a framework to support . 
that is why I talk of cooperative federalism , where the Central and State partner . 
I cooperative and the Global Competitiveness Index of federalism , which is also the State investment and nine he drew करियां for each other from the competition . 
to this vision for the last year , we have fast to . 
when we old the Planning Commission institution named NITI Aayog of India , we have changed the first time in such institutions in the State Governments to formal , and a role . 
we have taken by the Union Government , State Governments more resources of the necessary बढ़ोतरी . 
and , when we auctions of coal more revenue कमाना , we launched the States , including with खानें of coal . 
I their respective Ministries to say that they conferences from Delhi on state capitals and other cities , so that they can take the benefits of such events . 
we do with the State Governments in a spirit of partnership with their concerns and to work with sensitivity . 
and , in doing so , we in the State on in position of political party , he no . 
so , when I State Governments to participate in this event with China , I with States , connectivity , thought about , but their comprehensive political representation of . 
each to the nation to strengthen our international partnerships required . 
integrated in the world of connectivity are going . 
trade , investment , innovation , technology , tourism , education , skills and health , such as in the areas of international partnerships , together with the State Governments of them have been rising interest in their success and responsibility have also been increased . 
I within and outside to come ” , the State delegations be that the state level connectivity , often more focused and useful . 
the State Governments many decision for at the earliest . 
it on the State Governments to sensitive and national activities and needs to be sensitive and aware . 
that is why I this platform and a great importance . 
India has a country with the first time platform . 
and it is appropriate that this launch has been with China . 
the world ’ s two major economies , are growing together with the fastest growing major economy in . 
we have greater economic engagement . 
we also face common challenges . 
we also have shared some experience . 
we both our countries to various parts of development in a different speed . 
our economic ties are going to . 
last year , Mr. Xi ’ during the visit , we have our economic ties to a new heights of an ambitious plan of the . 
we agreed that China Maharashtra and Gujarat two Industrial Park लगायेगा . 
we are pleased that the two States , the Chief Minister are present here . 
India ’ s Railway sector between us of the MoU on Cooperation in . 
I have Chinese companies in India ’ s manufacturing sector , invited investment in India . 
President Xi over the next five years ( billion ) 20 billion dollars of Chinese investments . 
some of the trade Agreement will be in Shanghai tomorrow . 
I believe that if provincial and State Governments close contact in our vision , that is easier . 
our other interests and also will be – especially people-to-people contact at to carry forward the momentum of all relations , which is at the centre of . 
between India and China , Gujarat and गुआंगदोंग already ( relationship in the State रिलेशनशिप टर-स , ) . 
in many cities of our relations such as ( System टर-सिटी रिलेशंस ) . 
during the visit , we नाटक-सिचुआन relationship and in 4 cities system will start टर-सिटी relations . 
it is also a sense of , beginning with President Xi ’ in India ’ s Ahmedabad during the visit of was and I have also launched from a visit to Xian . 
these developments in the welcome . 
right ways to enhance our engagement in our national capitals go out of the state capitals and take cities . 
therefore , the Prime Minister with the beginning of this platform to is a matter of . 
“ became in India ” ( people ’ s vision is changed )

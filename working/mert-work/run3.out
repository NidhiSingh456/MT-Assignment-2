the सीपीएएफएफसी Madam Lee शाओलिन , 
the Chief Minister of Hon ’ ble Prime Minister , and Mayor , 
in the relations between India and China , it is a historic moment . 
today , we ongoing cooperation between the two countries and to pursue to a new beginning through . 
in the times to come , it is our economic partnership and our contacts between people to one of the most important instrument . 
the thirteen years , the Prime Minister and posts from one year , the Prime Minister of living in position as on of this platform has a special place in my heart . 
but , this new institution even more important due to my thoughts are not only . 
I share their experiences of दृढ़ believe that development of the State in the plays an important role . 
this demographic , social and economic level including highly such a large and densely populated countries , particularly in terms of the Session . 
when Constitutional and political systems , then the federal structure and this is more than is relevant . 
most of the world more densely populated countries in both India and China , these values . 
in the Constitution of India , State Governments of economic and social development is a major role in . 
the Union Government for the overall economic environment . 
he for a comprehensive social and economic set the agenda and their can . 
he launched policies and programmes for development . 
he management of resources . 
but , eventually , their implementation in the State Governments to play a pivotal role . 
but , as I have seen his experience , State Governments States , for the development of a number of initiatives . 
under the our Constitution the level of autonomy and accountability are the benefits of उठाती . 
equally , environment , the State in different level , on the are performance . 
business for investors , they also Indian or foreign , they have come to Delhi , but begin their success after state capitals depends on . 
success is important requirements , infrastructure , में- सुवि धाएं land of skilled human resources , and to end हैं-जो very little approvals involved in the State Governments are rely on . 
but , for me , our national effort of the States in his statutory only partnership and legal responsibility is not because of . 
it also infrastructure management creates principle . 
when we all in the spirit of partnership , when we are all success in part , with the spirit of success is going . 
that is why I talk of Team India . 
that is why I am confident that India ’ s development of the Union Government ’ s only pillar , but will not be that the Union Government and our all State Governments as 30 pillar . 
it simple norms of science that it is the foundation for stronger and more stable . 
it is very large infrastructure development can serve the . 
that is why I talk of cooperative federalism , where the Central and State partner . 
I cooperative and the Global Competitiveness Index of federalism where states , I am also , investment and nine states to drew करियां for each other ’ the competitive . 
to this vision for the last year , we have worked with speed . 
the Planning Commission , when we old institution named NITI Aayog , we have changed from India , the first time in such institutions in the State Governments and formal place of the role . 
we have taken by the Union Government , State Governments more resources in the amount of बढ़ोतरी essential . 
and , when we auctions of coal more revenue कमाना , we launched the States with खानें of coal , which are located . 
from their Ministries , I say that they conferences from Delhi on state capitals and other cities are in them , so that they too can get the benefits of such events . 
we do with the State Governments and the spirit of partnership with their concerns with sensitivity to are working . 
and , we do so , in the State in position on of political party , thematic are not towards . 
so , when I spoke to the State Governments to participate in this event for the invitation with China , then I States of connectivity , about his thoughts , but also a political representation also spoke of . 
every nation for the progress of the strong international partnership , is the need for . 
in an integrated world , are going on . 
trade , investment , innovation , technology , tourism , education , skills and health , such as in the areas of international partnerships , together with the State Governments have been going their interest in their success and responsibility have also been increased . 
I within and outside , the two ahead of the State has to be the delegations from that the State level connectivity , often more focused and useful . 
the State Governments , by several decisions taken at the earliest . 
it on the State Governments and more sensitive and international and regional activities to the needs of more than sensitive and alert . 
I therefore this platform and a great importance . 
India has with the first time a platform to any country is created . 
and , it is a fitting that it was beginning with China . 
we are two major economies of the world economy are growing together with the fastest growing major economy in . 
we have greater economic cooperation . 
we also face common challenges . 
we also have shared some experience . 
we both our countries in various parts of the pace of development in different parts is a . 
our economic ties are going to . 
last year , Mr. Xi during the visit , we have to our economic relations to new heights of an ambitious plan fixed . 
we agreed that China Maharashtra and Gujarat in two Industrial Park लगायेगा . 
we are pleased that the two States , the Chief Minister of are present here . 
India ’ s Railway sector between us the reform of the MoU on Cooperation in . 
I have Chinese companies to India ’ s manufacturing sector , invited investment in India . 
the President Xi has in the next five years ( billion ) 20 billion dollars of Chinese investments . 
some of the trade Agreement will be in Shanghai tomorrow . 
I believe that if provincial and the State Governments , near on to work in our vision , that is easier . 
our other interests will also – especially , mutual respect between the people on in the sector , to promote the centre of all relations . 
between India and China and Gujarat , already relations in गुआंगदोंग ( System रिलेशनशिप टर-स , State level ) . 
in many cities of our relations such as रिलेशंस टर-सिटी System ( a ) . 
during the visit , relationship , we can in 4 cities and नाटक-सिचुआन system will start टर-सिटी relations . 
it is also a sense of , beginning with President Xi of India in Ahmedabad during the visit of the beginning was and I have from a visit to Xian . 
this programme developments are welcome . 
we right ways to its relations in our national capitals go out of the state capitals and cities are going to take .

the सीपीएएफएफसी Madam शाओलिन New Delhi , 
Honourable Chief Minister of governance , the Mayor and , 
India and China relations , it is a historic moment . 
today , we ongoing cooperation between the two countries and to pursue a new through the beginning of . 
in the coming years , our economic partnership and our contacts between people to one of the most important instrument . 
the thirteen years , the Chief Minister systems and a year , the Prime Minister on this platform to be in position as a special place in my heart . 
but , this new institution even more important because of my thoughts are not only . 
our experiences of दृढ़ I believe that in the development of the State important role . 
the demographic , social and economic level highly or a and densely populated countries in terms of , in particular . 
when statutory and political systems , federal structure for this , even more relevant . 
the world ’ s more densely populated countries in both India and China these values . 
in the Constitution of India , State Governments ’ s economic and social development is a key role . 
the Union Government for the overall economic environment . 
he for a comprehensive social and economic the agenda and their can be . 
he launched on development policies and programmes . 
he of resources management . 
but , after their work , in the implementation of the State Governments to play a pivotal role . 
but , as I have seen his experience , State Governments States , for the development of many initiatives . 
our under the Constitution the level of autonomy and responsibility उठाती of . 
common national environment , State different level , the . 
business for investors , they also Indian or foreign , they have come from New Delhi , but started after their success state capitals depends on . 
success is important में- needs infrastructure , land , सुवि धाएं of skilled human resources , and is involved in हैं-जो approvals in the State Governments rely on . 
but , for me , our national endeavour in the States , the participation of his statutory and legal responsibility because of . 
it also infrastructure management creates principle . 
when we all in the spirit of partnership , when we are all success in his part , of success , is going . 
that is why I talk of Team India . 
that is why I am confident that India ’ s growth of the Union Government ’ s only pillar , but will not be that the Union Government and our all State Governments as 30 of the best . 
this simple norms of science that it is the foundation for stronger and more stable . 
the development of the major infrastructure support . 
that is why I talk of cooperative federalism , where the Central and State to partner . 
I cooperative and the Global Competitiveness Index of federalism also , including the State investment and nine he drew करियां for from each other ’ s . 
to this vision for the last year , we have quickly . 
when we old the Planning Commission named NITI Aayog institution , we have changed from India for the first time in such institutions in the State Governments to formal the role and . 
we have taken by the Union Government , State Governments more resources in the necessary बढ़ोतरी . 
and , when we auctions of coal more revenue कमाना , we launched the States , including with खानें of coal . 
I from their Ministries , he said that conferences from Delhi on state capitals and other cities , so that they can take the benefits of such events . 
we do the State Governments in partnership with the spirit of their concerns and to work with sensitivity . 
and , we do so , we , in the State on the political parties in position of monuments , no . 
so , when I State Governments to participate in this event with China , I with States , connectivity , thought about , but their comprehensive political representation of . 
each to the nation , for the progress made a strong international partnership , the required . 
integrated in the world of connectivity are going . 
trade , investment , innovation , technology , tourism , education , skills and health , in areas such as the international partnerships with together , the State Governments of them have been rising interest in their success and responsibility have also been increased . 
I have to within and outside , to the State delegations be that the state level connectivity , often more focused and useful . 
the State Governments several decisions taken at the earliest . 
it on the State Governments and more sensitive and national activities and needs to be sensitive and aware . 
that is why I this platform and a great importance . 
India has a country with the first time of platform . 
and it is appropriate that this launch has been with China . 
the world ’ s two major economies , are increasingly together with the fastest growing major economy in . 
we have greater economic engagement . 
we also face common challenges . 
we also have shared some experience . 
we both our countries to various parts of development in a separate momentum . 
our economic ties are going to . 
last year , Mr. Xi ’ during the visit , we have to our economic relations to new heights an ambitious plan of the . 
we agreed that China Maharashtra and Gujarat in two Industrial Park लगायेगा sector . 
we are pleased that the two states , the Chief Minister of the present here .

this is the world ’ s challenges in the collective efforts of the rich and poor countries with the can . 
but , we know that this disparity may , to more than संहारक can make and environmental damage to progress . 
have we ever thought of the implications on after in is that we have climate change ; have never with the result of our decisions . 
for example , information technology development and capacity to enhance productivity , has been ; although , the various भटकाव we can ease having . 
as many times that we are in the meeting and संदेशों in the farmers of greed . 
so , when we science and human development , we speak of this equality , principles and access of political decisions .

I believe that in India ’ s ideals is more than . 
I our Ministries subsidised that they for research on the request of funds to support and institutions of cooperation with the necessary up . 
our University highly regulation and on the shackles of बोझि processes free . 
there on अकादमि of freedom and autonomy should be education and training of research should also be on .

the सीपीएएफएफसी Madam शाओलिन New Delhi , 
the Chief Minister of Hon ’ ble Prime Minister , and Mayor , 
India and China relations in this historic region . 
today , we will continue cooperation between the two countries and to a new for the launch of . 
in the times to come , our economic partnership and our contacts between people to one of the most important instrument . 
the thirteen years , the Chief Minister systems and a year , the Prime Minister on the living in position as the special place in my heart . 
but , the new institution even more important than to of my thoughts are not only . 
their experiences of the दृढ़ I believe that the State in the development of the important role . 
the demographic , social and economic at the highest such a and densely populated countries in the case of a special . 
when the highest political systems and the federal structure , then the and more than relevant . 
the world ’ s more densely populated countries in both India and China these values . 
the Constitution of India , in the State Government ’ s economic and social development is a major role in . 
the Union Government for the overall economic environment . 
he for a comprehensive social and economic set the agenda and their . 
he launched the development of policies and programmes . 
he resources management . 
but , after , their implementation in the State Governments to play a key role . 
but , as I have seen his experience , State Governments States for development of a number of initiatives . 
our under the Constitution the level of autonomy and the benefits of उठाती . 
equally , in an atmosphere , the State different level on . 
business for investors , they also Indian or foreign , have come from New Delhi , but begin their success after state capitals depends on . 
the success is important needs में- infrastructure , land , सुवि धाएं of skilled human resources , and is approvals हैं-जो involved in the end , the State Governments on . 
but , for me , our national endeavour in the States of the his statutory and legal responsibility because of . 
it also infrastructure management , creates . 
when we all participation in the spirit of the , when we all success in his part , of success , is going . 
that is why I talk of Team India . 
that is why I am confident that India ’ s development of the Union Government ’ s only pillar , but will not be that the Union Government and our all State Governments as 30 of the best . 
the science of ordinary norms of that the foundation for stronger and more stable . 
the development of a framework to support . 
that is why I talk of cooperative federalism , where the Union and State partner . 
I cooperative and the Global Competitiveness Index of federalism also , including the State investment and nine drew a करियां for each other from the competition . 
to this vision for the last year , we have to work . 
when we old scheme to the institution named NITI Aayog of India , we have changed , the first time in such institutions in the State Governments to formal , and the role of . 
we have taken by the Union Government , State Governments to more resources of the in बढ़ोतरी . 
and , when we have the auction of coal , more than the कमाना , we launched the States , including with of coal खानें . 
I Ministries to say that they conferences to Delhi with state capitals and other cities , so that they can take the benefits of such events . 
we do with the State Governments partnership with the spirit of their concerns and sensitivity to work . 
and , in doing so , we in the State , in position on the political parties , he no . 
so , when I State Governments to participate in the event of China , I with the States of connectivity in , of thought , but their a political representation of . 
each to the nation , for the progress of strong international partnership , the need for . 
an integrated world in on progress . 
trade , investment , innovation , technology , tourism , education , skills and , in areas such as international partnerships , together with the State Governments in the interest of progress and their success in the also . 
I have to within and outside to come ” , the State for the delegations to be that the State level , on October , the more focused and useful . 
the State Governments many decision for at the earliest . 
it on the State Governments to sensitive and national activities and needs to be sensitive and aware . 
that is why I this platform and a great importance . 
India has a country with the first time this platform . 
and it is a appropriate that this with China . 
the world ’ s two major economy are growing together with the fastest growing major economy in . 
our large economic cooperation . 
we also face common challenges . 
we also have shared some experience . 
we both our countries to various parts of development in a different speed . 
our economic ties are going to . 
last year , Mr. Xi ’ during the visit , we have our economic relations to new heights of an ambitious plan of the . 
we agreed that China Maharashtra and Gujarat in the Industrial Park लगायेगा . 
we are pleased that the Chief Minister are present here . 
our of India ’ s railway sector on cooperation in the . 
I have Chinese companies in India ’ s manufacturing sector for investment in the invitation . 
President Xi for the next five years ( 20 billion dollars billion ) of the Chinese investments . 
some of the trade Agreement will be in Shanghai tomorrow . 
I believe that if the provincial and State Governments near on in the sector , our vision that is easier . 
our other interests of the will be – especially cooperation between the people on the other , relations in all the Centre . 
between India and China , Gujarat and गुआंगदोंग in respect of ( System टर-स State रिलेशनशिप , ) . 
in many cities of our relationship ( such as the टर-सिटी रिलेशंस ) . 
during the visit , we नाटक-सिचुआन relations and four cities in the टर-सिटी ties will launch . 
it is also a spirit of , beginning with President Xi ’ in India ’ s Ahmedabad during the visit of was and I have also launched from a visit to Xian . 
the developments in the welcome . 
we right ways to our engagement in our national capitals to the extent of State capitals to and cities . 
therefore , the Prime Minister with the beginning of this platform to is a matter of .

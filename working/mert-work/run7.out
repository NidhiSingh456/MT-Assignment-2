but this related stakeholders for the benefit of . 
for me , the World Bank ’ s the Report reflects the determination and hard work of change is possible . 
I say this because India that in the has where now easier to improve further . 
our efforts to it . 
in the management of Firstly , we have easy UDAN for serious occasion .

it to any country of the most . 
– the WIPO of the Global Innovation Index in the last two years , we 21 up . 
– World Bank ’ s Logistics Performance Index of the moved up 19 places on in 2016 . 
our is reform , perform and change .

in March 2016 , for FDI 55.6 billion U.S. dollars on all-time level . 
in India next year 60.08 billion U.S. dollars of FDI , which go beyond more .

science and technology , to the boundaries of लांघते , the world to पिरोता and in the spread of peace . 
it the challenges of the collective efforts in the rich and poor countries can bring with . 
but , we know that it may inequality , to more than संहारक can make and environment to damaged . 
sometimes we never complexities subsequently as in climate change that we have with ; never never the result of our own decisions . 
for example , information technology development and to enhance productivity has been ; although , the various भटकाव ease can having us . 
as many times that we are in a meeting and in the संदेशों is of greed .

सीपीएएफएफसी of शाओलिन Madam New Delhi , 
the Chief Minister Hon ’ ble Prime Minister , and Mayor , 
India and China relations in this historic moment . 
today , we ongoing cooperation between the two countries and to pursue to a new through the launch of . 
in the times to come , our economic partnership and our contacts between people to one of the most important means . 
the thirteen years the Chief Minister systems and a year , the Prime Minister on living in position as of this platform is a special place in my heart . 
but , this new institution even more important than to of my thoughts are not only . 
our experiences of दृढ़ I believe that development of State in an important role . 
the demographic , social and economic level highly such a and densely populated countries in terms of a . 
when Constitutional and political systems , federal structure for this , and more than relevant . 
the world ’ s more densely populated countries in both India and China these values . 
Constitution of India , in the State Governments ’ s economic and social development is a major role in . 
the Union Government overall economic environment . 
he for a comprehensive social and economic set the agenda and their . 
he launched policies and schemes for development . 
he resources management . 
but , after all , their implementation in the State Governments to play a pivotal role . 
but , as I have seen his experience , State Governments States , for the development of many initiatives . 
our under the Constitution the level of autonomy and the benefits of उठाती . 
common National in an environment , State different level , on the . 
business for investors , they also Indian or foreign , have come from New Delhi , but their success after all state capitals on . 
success is important needs में- infrastructure , a land , सुवि धाएं , skilled human resources and is in the end हैं-जो obtaining clearances from the State Governments on . 
but , for me , our national endeavour in the States of only his statutory and legal responsibility because of . 
it also infrastructure management the principle creates . 
when we all in the spirit of partnership , , when we all have to success in his part , of success , is going . 
that is why I talk of Team India . 
that is why I am sure that India ’ s growth of the Union Government ’ s only pillar , but will not be that the Union Government and our all State Governments as 30 of , . 
the science of ordinary rules of that the foundation is strong and more stable . 
the development of a framework to support . 
that is why I talk of cooperative federalism , where the Centre and State partner . 
I cooperative and the Global Competitiveness Index of federalism , which is also the State investment and nine a drew करियां for each other from the competition . 
this give shape to the vision of last year , we have fast to . 
when we have the old Planning Commission institution named NITI Aayog of India , we have changed the first time in such institutions in the State Governments to formal , and a role . 
we have by the Union Government , State Governments more resources of the necessary बढ़ोतरी . 
and , when we have coal auctions of more revenue कमाना , we launched the States , including with खानें of coal . 
I their respective Ministries to say that they conferences to Delhi state capitals and other cities are in , so that they too can receive the benefit of such events . 
we do with the State Governments and the spirit of partnership with their concerns sensitivity to work . 
and , in doing so , we have a State in on in position of political party , he no . 
so , when I State Governments to participate in this event for the invitation with China , I have the States of connectivity , thought about , but their a political representation of . 
each to the nation for the progress of the strong international partnerships is the need for . 
integrated in the world of connectivity are going . 
trade , investment , innovation , technology , tourism , education , skills and health , in areas such as the international partnerships , together with the State Governments of interest has been going them and their success in the also . 
I have within and outside coming , the State delegations be that the state , connectivity , often more focused and useful . 
the State Governments many decision for water , . 
it on the State Governments to and more sensitive and National activities and needs to be sensitive and aware . 
that is why I this platform and a great importance . 
India has a country with the first time platform . 
and it is appropriate that this launch has been with China . 
the world ’ s two the fastest growing large economies are growing together with the fastest growing major economy in . 
our greater economic engagement . 
we also face common challenges . 
we also have shared some experience . 
we both our countries various parts of development in a different speed . 
our economic ties are going to . 
last year , Mr. Xi of during the visit , we have our economic relations to a new heights of a ambitious set . 
we agreed that China Maharashtra and Gujarat two Industrial Park लगायेगा . 
we are pleased that the two States of the Chief Minister are present here . 
India ’ s Railway sector between us the reform of the MoU on cooperation in . 
I have Chinese companies to the manufacturing sector in India for investment in invited . 
President Xi has in the next five years ( billion ) 20 billion dollars of Chinese investments . 
some business Agreement will be in Shanghai tomorrow . 
I believe that if the provincial and the State Governments near connectivity in , our vision that very easy . 
our other interests and also will be – especially people to people contact , to carry forward the momentum of all relations , which is at the centre of . 
between India and China , Gujarat and गुआंगदोंग already ( relationship in the State टर-स रिलेशनशिप , ) . 
our in many cities also such relationship ( System टर-सिटी रिलेशंस ) . 
during the visit , we नाटक-सिचुआन relations , and in 4 cities system will mark the start of a टर-सिटी relations . 
it is also a sense of , beginning with President Xi ’ in India ’ s Ahmedabad during the visit of was and I have also launched from a visit to Xian . 
these developments , are welcome . 
right ways to its relations in our national capitals go out of the state capitals and cities are to be . 
therefore , the Prime Minister with the beginning of this platform to is a matter of .

it ’ s challenges in the collective efforts of the rich and poor countries can bring with . 
but , we know that this disparity may , to make more संहारक and damaged in the environment . 
sometimes we never complexities subsequently as in climate change is that we have the never never . with the result of our own decisions . 
for example , information technology development potential and has been to enhance productivity ; although , the ease various भटकाव can having us . 
as many times that we are in a meeting in संदेशों and education in the greed . 
so , when we science and human development , we talk about this equality , principles and access of political decisions .

we should also consider the that science , technology but , the local . 
if we traditional and local knowledge , systems and technologies to it , the more we appropriate , effective , affordable and sustainable solutions that can develop human development and progress of huge contribution . 
Government in the country , science and technology , the a , as also to develop should increase . 
when I employment in the country to talk about I also want to research and development in the country on as also focus . 
the proposed to be levied in not more , बैठक- application of research requirements should not be more complex , the approval process of the National Conference should not be a barrier for our scientific departments to cover research activities uncertainties inherent in चिताओं on the basis of funds to about decision in flexible .

our University highly Regulation under the shackles of and बोझि on processes should be free . 
there will be on अकादमि of freedom and autonomy , should be and education of research should also be on . 
we our Higher Education areas to expand our existing institutions must however in the shortage of faculty . 
our industry to industry , science and technology in the region is to promote investments . 
India`s own pharmaceutical industry has , in the world is our identity , because it research in the region .

the सीपीएएफएफसी Madam शाओलिन New Delhi , 
the Chief Minister Hon ’ ble Prime Minister , and Mayor , 
India and China relations , in this historic sector . 
today , we cooperation between the two countries and a new to pursue , are making a beginning of . 
in the times to come , it and our economic partnership between our people to one of the most important instrument . 
the thirteen years for the Chief Minister systems and a year , the Prime Minister ’ s in position as on this Forum is a special place in my heart . 
but , the new institution have even more important than due to my thoughts are not only . 
I share their experiences of दृढ़ believe that the State in the development of the important role . 
the demographic , social and economic level highly on such a and densely populated countries in terms of the special session . 
when statutory and political systems , federal structure for this , even more relevant . 
the world ’ s more densely populated countries in both India and China , these values . 
in the Constitution of India , State Governments ’ s economic and social development is a major role in . 
the Union Government overall economic environment . 
he for comprehensive social and economic the agenda and their can be . 
he launched developmental policies and programmes . 
he resources management . 
but , after , their implementation in the State Governments to play a pivotal role . 
but , as I have seen his experience , State Governments States , for the development of the initiative . 
under our Constitution the level of autonomy and responsibility उठाती the benefits of . 
common national environment , State in different level , on the . 
for business investors , they also Indian or foreign , they have come from New Delhi , but their success after state capitals depends on . 
success is important needs में- infrastructure , land , सुवि धाएं , a skilled human resources and is in the end हैं-जो obtaining clearances from the State Governments , on . 
but , for me , our national endeavour in States , participation of his statutory and legal responsibility because of . 
also infrastructure management creates principle . 
when we all in the spirit of partnership , when we are all success , in part , with a success , is going . 
that is why I talk about Team India . 
that is why I am confident that India ’ s development to the Union Government ’ s only pillar , but not the that the Union Government and our all State Governments as 30 of the best . 
it simple of science that the rules of the foundation for strong and more stable . 
the development of a framework to support . 
that is why I talk of cooperative federalism , where the Union and State partner . 
I , cooperative and the Global Competitiveness Index of federalism where states also , investment and nine the drew करियां for each other on the competition , . 
to this vision of last year , we have quickly . 
when we have to the NITI Aayog old scheme titled institution , we have changed from the first time in India , such institutions in the State Governments to formal place and role . 
we have by the Union Government , State Governments more resources of the needs of the बढ़ोतरी . 
and , when we auctions of coal more revenue कमाना , we launched the States , including with खानें of coal . 
our Ministries , I say that they conferences to Delhi , to state capitals and other cities , so that they can take the benefits of such events . 
we do with the State Governments and the spirit of partnership with their concerns of the sensitivity to . 
and , in doing so , we in the state , political parties in position on the concerns of monuments no . 
so , when I State Governments to participate in this event invited China , I with States , connectivity , about thought , but trading represents a political of . 
each to the nation for the strong international of regional partnership . 
in an integrated world , are going on . 
trade , investment , innovation , technology , tourism , education , skills and health , such as in international partnerships together , with , the State Governments of progress in interest in their success and responsibility have been also . 
I within and outside , to the State delegations be that the state level conference on often more focused and useful . 
the State Governments , many decision for soon , . 
it on the State Governments to sensitive and national activities and needs to be sensitive and aware . 
that is why I this platform and the . ” 
India has a first time with platform of the country . 
and it is appropriate that this launch has been with China . 
the world ’ s two major economy are growing together with the fastest growing major economy in . 
we have greater economic cooperation . 
we also face common challenges . 
we also have shared some experience . 
we both our countries has various parts of development in a different momentum . 
our economic ties are going to . 
in the last year , the Prime Minister Xi ’ during the visit , we have to our economic relations to new heights an ambitious scheme of the . 
we agreed that China Maharashtra and Gujarat two Industrial Park लगायेगा . 
we are pleased that the Chief Minister are present here . 
India ’ s Railway sector between us the reform of the MoU on cooperation in . 
I Chinese companies to the manufacturing sector in India , invited investment in . 
President Xi has in the next five years 20 billion ( billion ) of the Chinese investments . 
some business Agreement will be in Shanghai tomorrow . 
I believe that if the provincial and the State Governments , near connectivity to work in our vision , that is easier . 
it will take our other interest will also of the people of cooperation between – especially on to carry forward the momentum of all relations , which is at the centre of . 
between India and China and Gujarat , in गुआंगदोंग already relationship ( System , टर-स रिलेशनशिप are the ) . 
our many cities also in such relationship ( System रिलेशंस ) टर-सिटी . 
during the visit , we नाटक-सिचुआन relations and 4 cities of टर-सिटी relations , will launch . 
it is also a , beginning with President Xi ’ in India ’ s Ahmedabad during the visit of was and I have also started from a visit to Xian . 
these developments , the welcome . 
we our relationship to a truly our national capitals go out of the state capitals and cities are being to . 
therefore , the Prime Minister with the beginning of this platform to is a matter of . 
“ became in India ” , the Prime Minister said ( people ’ s thinking ) changed 
India ’ s solution to all problems is development
